✓Camera is decent outdoors, without enough lighting it struggles like hell.

2 cons,
Battery and speaker.

Advice to Gamers.(To avoid overheating of CPU)

Go to power Settings and Advanced and reduce the CPU usage to 80%.(while gaming)

Also Try to play Game on Max settings possible for you with 50-60fps.That will really help you maintain CPU temperature around 60-65°c

I have played AC Valhalla, Odyssey,DMC5,Sekiro,Forza and everything runs well.

IMPORTANT ADVICE!

First and foremost I'll say this, If your laptop is working fine YOU DO NOT NEED TO DO ANY OF THESE STEPS BELOW AS YOU'LL BE DOING THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND IF NOT DONE PROPERLY MIGHT DAMAGE AS WELL AS VOID YOUR WARRANTY SO PLEASE TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATION.

If you have purchased this laptop or are going to, I highly recommend, to REPLACE THE THERMAL Paste, MSI is known to be using extremely poor quality and thermal past...

If you want to buy camera than only kit lens is not just you want from your pics. You have to upgrade with any prime lens,whether it's 50mm or 55-250mm.

And does a fine job out of the box. And editing some photos may also shock you with excellent results. 10/10 Will recommend. If you're a beginner and looking to stick with a DSLR and grow with it then look no further. I've added 2 of the best photos I took with the stock lens. Used Lightroom to finish it off.","['5', 'Brilliant']"

Honestly speaking I wanted to buy 700d, then 750d, then 800d, then 200d then finally got 200d Mark II. (Just understand the feeling, don't use too much logic here)

So basically speaking, waited a lot, explored a lot, then finally spent a lot and for this one.

So I am no professional photographer but not that amature as well. It's been 1 month I've been using it, exploring the features and what I can say is ""it's a great camera"".

I can take sharp photos seamlessly.

I am not quite satisfied with it's low-light performance. Both the kit lenses are not that great for low light. You'll either need to increase the ISO sensitivity or the shutter speed and in either ways the image won't be that great.

The overall performance is great and I'm planning to take more and more pictures.","['4', 'Really Nice']"

I tempted for 4K recording of 15min. But the thing is you'll get an overheating warning after 5 min of 4k recording. So, you should end up with 1080p. In this case I should have gone with sony camera as it has top notch auto focus system where it is too far in xt200...

Pre Note: If you are here to buy this for video recording, vlogging or any type of video content creating then this not your choice.

I have compared sony alpha and fuji xt200 made a bad choice by buying xt200.

I tempted for 4K recording of 15min. But the thing is you'll get an overheating warning after 5 min of 4k recording. So, you should end up with 1080p. In this case I should have gone with sony camera as it has top notch auto focus system where it is too far in xt200...

6737,5,Product is great. Gets charge quickly and last for long. Sound and built quality is best within this price range. Not recommended for gamers though as letency is high. Great for watching movies or listening to music. Only problem is in calling. I have to keep left on ear and on right side hanging as it brings mic closer to mouth so that other end can hear the call clearly. If not than other end often complains about not hearing my voice clearly while using this earphone.,"['5', 'Highly recommended']"

Battery life is fantastic i got around 15 to 16hrs. Volume is too high so can't go over 50%. Build quality looks nice, feels sturdy and the cable is braided. The fit is comfortable and Weightless. Sound quality is above average. Yeah bass is present. Call quality is excell...

As price is concern the sound quality is quite good must say, no lag in connection if the versions are updated. It can catch a good distance and gives a good battery backup as well as good sound also.

Sound-
First thing first if you like to hear just bass and don't care about anything else then don't buy this one, go for Boat or Realme, but if you are like me who likes well balance sound with decent base then i think this is the best headset for this price, bass is not overpowering nether its dull its just comes alive when you need it.

About product it's like awesome having better build quality, bass is good, battery backup is fine and vibration though it vibrates my neck when ever I gets call but still feature is must needed when u are driving. Wanted to give 5star but there is a sentence that "" Nothing is perfect in this imperfect world"" 😄😄😉","['5', 'Excellent']"

7184,5,"For the first time, I am posting a review, just because the product compelled me to do so. Icouldn't find a single aspect missed or mis-handled by Boat. Well this is called, quality engineering. Well, some people say Boat enhances bass and thus compensates with clarity, but I would give my neutral and true feedback
Bass : 10/10
Clarity : 9/10
Comfort ease n looks : 15/10
Features :10/10

*Pros- 1Good battery backup
2Good sound quality

*Cons-1 There's a voice gap between video activity and voice. Voice comes after video activity not both comes together. It is ok when you watch movies and music but if you play pubg with it you will clearly feel the big gap it matters a lot for me. It is not working after 4 month very much disappointed

Not satisfied at this price... Boat rockerzz 255 is too much better then these eardopes at this price rate...

7291,5,"And yes there you go...You have the best in-budget tws....
First of all, let me get something straight- It has amazing sound quality
A decent bass
A nice battery backup
But it lacks only in built design. Yes these are not much comfortable for long durations.
My verdict:- If you are a comfort lover then these are not meant for you.
You should then go for some tws with vacuum grip.
Edit:- Since I'm now used to it, it seems very comfortable to me...
Just go for it","['5', 'Super!']"

No sound even in full volume. but it's also kinda good for ur ears and head. if u come to it's design, man it's superbly made with that hawk inspiration. and also the wires are also very thick where there'll not be any damage ...

9244,5,"Ok so lemme start from the basics, the Earphones are comfortable, if I'd have to guess then I'd say that it cancels out around 80-90% of the noise around you.

The Pros: this is gonna be mutual traits, the bass on this is CHONKERS and I mean it, they are comfortable to wear, not to mention the magnets on the top of the ear pieces, they are quite clicky too.

Cons: None as of now, I do wanna point out that for some the bass might be a little over the top.

This is my second pair of these earp...

9245,4,"For me the main attraction is the build quality. The main cable is very durable. Although I don't know about the joints. It would've been super if the Y split cables were braided too. Now, the sound quality could've been better. Bass is muddy which overpowers mids and highs. Although because it has a higher volume than other similar earphones the highs are very shrill if you listen to full volume. But I know most of average Indians who are looking for a budget earphone will most certainly lov...

Previously i have used boat 225 which has one of the best bass under 600 & I loved them both the built & sound was superb.

Now after purchasing realme buds 2 I can say my 600rs was well spent & it has better sound quality than boat 225 hands down the base is punchy & thumping, those 11.2mm drivers are working excellent, probably this is the 225 killer.

Realme released Buds 2 Neo which is 100 cheaper than this but go for Buds 2 instead of Neo and Buds 2 has more premium and sturdy cable.

I tried different types of wired earphones in the past under 1k price range including boat, sony, jbl etc but none of them lasted more than 6 months for my usage, but the best budget earphones for me is Redmi Basic which is under 399 but they are not available since 1 year so I had to buy Realme buds 2 which ...

Especially the surrounding music gives you an amazing feel. speaking of the build quality the braided cables are good, but some people complaining that it's not having an L-shaped Jack, but for me it's not a problem as I've already used boat 225 earphones it has L-shaped Jack but it doesn't last so long...

And if you want to buy this product it will be good but be sure that the ink used is only pG-47 and CL-57 that is specific for it.. and the cost of this ink cartridge is heigh .. it gives only 250 pages for black and white and aroun180-200 coloured.

Ink cartridges (XL) cost is more than that of the printer itself. No other similar cartridges available in the market so that you have an option which one to buy.
Better not to buy it, event if it is a cheap and good quality. We have to keep in mind- A printer is not a show-piece; it has to print day to day.","['2', 'Better not to buy.']"

Suggestions for buyers and users-
1. If you think that printing cost is high then try refilling the cartridge. It cost 150 rupees per bottle of ink and has 100 ml. Cartridge can be refilled upto 20-25 times from ink bottle. After refilling the printing cost of color mode comes down to 0.99 to 1.20 rupees and black 0.30 rupees estimated by me.
2. No problem with software.

Don't ever ever buy this printer.. only in 6 months of usage we need to change the drum which is available nowhere and it's price is also very high.. ink is so difficult to put in, half the times ink falls out..

When we put in new ink, still error will keep showing low on ink.. and new ink for around Rs.900, we don't get 900 pages in total..

Better picture modes for different needs(Gaming, Cinema, Photo Editing etc)

Better picture modes for different needs(Gaming, Cinema, Photo Editing etc)

Those who are used to use LCD monitor without backlight they will definitely make complaint.

I got replacement. But replacement was also had this quality issues.
In fact it is not manufacturing defect. It is design error.

Sad thing is that Flipkart avoided to give refund by giving false assurances

Two external antennas cover most of my 2 BHK flat (Except one blind spot).
AC750 - both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands operate very well, though 5GHz range is much less than 2.4GHz.
All the LED indicators are on the top (for keeping at table height), so if you are going to place it at a height on the wall, you won't be able to see the LED indicators (my case). In that case, one can go for Archer C20i AC750, which is same category vertical model with internal antennas....

1. Flipkart delivered the product before the estimate time.
2. In this price range this is the best router.
3. 2.4GHz has better frequency than 5GHz. But 5GHz speed is awesome.
4. Stable network from both band.
In short its a truly satisfying router.","['5', 'Brilliant']"

Also if u want a great range ,for 2.4 GHz it gives fabulous range but for 5 GHz it give only 10 feet overall range in a spare... Still the quality and performance wise one of the finest ...

14444,5,"Got it on the second day after placing the order. Thanks to Flipkart team for faster delivery. Now coming to the product review, I bought it for extending range of my JioFi. I don't have broadband connection, so I use the router as a repeater. So, it does works as a repeater. First, I tested in an open area.

14447,5,Best Dual band router in this price I buy at 999/- awesome range of both band the important thing is placement of router I placed in centre of my house(2500sqft) height of 9 ft it cover all my House . it surprise me when I got 2wifi signals in last room at 5ghz plan of internet is 60mbps of alliance broadband at 5ghz I got 65mbps and 50mbps at 2.4ghz,"['5', 'Just wow!']"
14448,3,"Cost effective but with very limited Speeds and range.

This dual band router is available for offers from Rs 1200 onwards which enticed me into buying the same. The router was pretty easy to setup and installation did not prove to be a hassle.

But the range of the 5GHz and 2.4 GHz antennas leave a lot to be desired. In a two story house, you can pretty much ignore the 5GHz as the range is very limited, maybe to the room in which the router is kept. Even though the 2.4GHz range is available ...

DIR-819 was dual band router one based on 2.4 GHz and another is 5 GHz . With have maximum capable speed of 750 Mbps. Build quality is best plastic body with glass finished.

This does not have a modem inbuilt. If you want to connect to an ADSL / Telephone line you will have to either buy a separate modem or use another product.

1. High speed wireless.

Speed and network stability is good.
And one positive thing I felt is we have android apk to control the router. So we can do some of the things using app itself instead ...

Please don't buy this product because

Ordered it during Big Billions Day and received within 48 hours. Set up was damn easy (15-20 min).

17711,4,Great system for the price. The USP is the woofer. Satellite speakers are average if you are connecting it to a Aux cable. But you will get better results using optical port but doesn't support 5.1 surround from PS3 or 4. This converts 2.1 to 5.1 using in built Prologic system which is decent but won't get actual individual surround sound to each speaker.,"['4', 'Value-for-money']"

Awesome bass. Big subwoofer.
Because of small extra treble speakers, treble sound is good. Better than philips.
Sound details are good.
Control from fenda app is easy.

17940,4,I have been using it for more than 6 months now. It's a beautiful piece of equipment that complements your room. It offers powerful sound with great bass that you can even feel. Sound quality is good. Only slight problem is that the pilot speakers wire attachment with subwoofer sometimes becomes loose. Never used FM but bluetooth and Aux works perfectly fine. Delivery was quick and set was in nice condition. Happy with purchase.,"['4', 'Good quality product']"

Over all:-
Great deal. I am happy with the purchase. I bought this for 4449 during festive sale. Thanks flipkThe output is good for this price range. The output sound is decent and you can hear even the minute instrumentals sound. Bass is decent. If you are extreme bass lover, then this is not your cup of tea. I was confused with F3800x and sony dav40. This one was under my buget, so i went with F3800x. Good output for good quality songs....

Now dont expect it to work great straight out of the box. You need to tweak somethings... I have a medium sized room and i use these speakers as 2.1 channel. So you will now think that only the front two speakers will work. No thats not the case.

Pros:
Awesome Bass and clarity
USB & SD card slots
Inbuilt Bluetooth and FM Radio
Long wires for satellite speakers
It gives Dolby surround effect

Cons:
It would have been better if it included 3.5mm to RCA AUX cable.

19308,5," Used this watch for over a month now.. Bought it during the first sale.. Keep reading for an unbiased review and tips/tricks to ensure all the functions in the watch are working smoothly.
1) Large Curved Display in this price category - 1.69 inch
2) Battery with heavy usage and frequently waking up the screen, alexa, alarms, notifications is about 3 days. On standby while just checking the time occassionally is about 8 days. Pretty good. Full charging time is about 1.5 hours. Decent quality magnetic charging cable provided. Use your own low power adapter, power bank or laptop.
3) Has all the necessary health / workout tracking options.. Spo2( Oxymeter), Heart Rate monitor..Accuracy is 95-98%. Sleep tracking is pretty accurate too. Paedometer is accurate most of the times, but sometimes few hundred steps are added randomly without any activity. This happens randomly once in 3-4 days. Stress Monitor is also there but not sure how it's calculated. The sensors aren not fake most probably because if the watch isn't in contact with your skin it will display a warning message and won't display data.
4) Lift to wake up gesture works but with a 1 second delay.. which is manageable. It has Tap to wake functionality too.
5) Works with most popular notifications: Whatsapp, SMS, Facebook, Instagram etc. Can read the entire SMS on watch and most of the other messages unless it's very long.
6) Calls can't be picked up or silenced.. You can only see the caller id and reject the call.
7) BT Music Control, Weather ☁️ update and Alexa are other usable smart features.
8) 50 different watch face are available on the Boat wave app. Some are really good.. You can also have customised wallpapers as watch faces . See the posted pictures.
9) The Boat Wave app is neatly organized and syncs health data without any issues instantly. The app also has assisted GPS functionality which can track your running activities on a map, in case you need that data.
10) The User Interface is smooth.. Please note that it's not laggy. The animations and transitions are a little slow but overall easy to use. Touch screen response is excellent and feels nice.
11) Overall construction is sturdy and feels nice and comfortable to wear it. It has water resistance of 5 ATM.. Can take it for a short duration swim in a pool, under the shower or rain without any worries. Watch uppper body is brushed aluminium and under body is good quality plastic. The straps are soft and also of very good quality. It doesn't irritate your skin even after wearing it for long durations. Four colour options are available with equally matching straps.. Straps can be easily replaced with fancy straps.
12 ) Works both with Android and iPhone flawlessly. Tested on both.

TIPs AND TRICKs ________________________________________

1) Boat wave app needs to run in the background all the time for your call notifications, message notifications, Alexa functionality and Weather updates. If you accidentally clear all the cache and background apps from the phone, the watch will disconnect from the phone after some time when idle ( no active inputs probably after 10-15 mins). Keep the boat wave app running in the background. Most people complaining that the watch frequently disconnected might unintentionally be clearing all the background apps. My watch was continuously connected for 4 straight days without me having to reconnect as long as the boat wave app was running in the background.

2) Alexa on this watch can do a lot of things..It can set your alarms, start the stopwatch, show weather, control Alexa based devices like Echo, wireless lights and AC, work as a simple calculator, translate simple/ short English sentences to German, Spanish, Italian, French and Portugese, get you common stock quotes from internet, can you snippets of general information from the internet in case you don't know something. Yes, Alexa on your watch getting you the information is a little slow, takes about 30 -40 seconds to process your request but it's convenient and better that taking out the phone from your pocket which might take similar amount of time or longer. In my personal experience, Alexa works a little faster on Android as compared to iphone ( maybe 2-3 second difference). Also if there is break while speaking or if there is a long sentence, then it's difficult for Alexa to understand.. Check my video.. Keep it short and you should get the results accurately
3) For Alexa to work properly: After connecting the Boat Wave app with an Amazon account, download the Alexa app and check your Xtend watch is visible under Devices option.
4) To pickup and make calls handsfree without using the phone, just use a Bluetooth headset with voice assistant function. It will work as a charm. The speaker function on most smart watches is useless as it's not convenient for calls while traveling or in a crowded place due to low volume and obviously you don't want everyone to hear your private conversation.. With voice assistant feature on your BT headset you can make a call or play music without having to touch your phone.

Few other functions which could have been provided and is missing. Actually available in many similarly priced devices :
1) Torch 🔦 - Makes the display bright white.. Comes handy in darkness.
2) Remote shutter button for camera.
3) Call silencing option could have been added.",['Best Budget watch']

 I was searching for a watch of rose gold color to gift my wife on our marriage anniversary. After browsing many products I chose Fossil Jesse Analog Rose Gold Dial Watch - ES3020.

Here are my observations:

1. The product was shipped to me on the date notified in advance without any hassle and follow-ups.

2. The packaging was okay. Though the case of the watch was an ordinary tin box.

3. The first look of the watch was not that good as it was shown in the photos displayed on the Amazon. The reason is its stone-studded dial and chain look like a local low-cost watches. The stones are bit big and do not look that elegant as I expected after paying almost eight thousand bucks. The advice of my friends flashed in my mind that it's always better to check the items like a watch in a store before opting for online purchase.

4. However, the product I received seemed original, and its cell was sealed.

5. The rose color of the watch is nice, but it's slightly heavy.

6. It is overpriced considering its overall appearance.

7. My wife has not complained about it's functioning after over a month use.

Overall verdict: An average looking watch at the higher cost.

19398,5," Used this watch for over a month now.. Bought it during the first sale.. Keep reading for an unbiased review and tips/tricks to ensure all the functions in the watch are working smoothly.
1) Large Curved Display in this price category - 1.69 inch
2) Battery with heavy usage and frequently waking up the screen, alexa, alarms, notifications is about 3 days. On standby while just checking the time occassionally is about 8 days. Pretty good. Full charging time is about 1.5 hours. Decent quality magnetic charging cable provided. Use your own low power adapter, power bank or laptop.
3) Has all the necessary health / workout tracking options.. Spo2( Oxymeter), Heart Rate monitor..Accuracy is 95-98%. Sleep tracking is pretty accurate too. Paedometer is accurate most of the times, but sometimes few hundred steps are added randomly without any activity. This happens randomly once in 3-4 days. Stress Monitor is also there but not sure how it's calculated. The sensors aren not fake most probably because if the watch isn't in contact with your skin it will display a warning message and won't display data.
4) Lift to wake up gesture works but with a 1 second delay.. which is manageable. It has Tap to wake functionality too.
5) Works with most popular notifications: Whatsapp, SMS, Facebook, Instagram etc. Can read the entire SMS on watch and most of the other messages unless it's very long.
6) Calls can't be picked up or silenced.. You can only see the caller id and reject the call.
7) BT Music Control, Weather ☁️ update and Alexa are other usable smart features.
8) 50 different watch face are available on the Boat wave app. Some are really good.. You can also have customised wallpapers as watch faces . See the posted pictures.
9) The Boat Wave app is neatly organized and syncs health data without any issues instantly. The app also has assisted GPS functionality which can track your running activities on a map, in case you need that data.
10) The User Interface is smooth.. Please note that it's not laggy. The animations and transitions are a little slow but overall easy to use. Touch screen response is excellent and feels nice.
11) Overall construction is sturdy and feels nice and comfortable to wear it. It has water resistance of 5 ATM.. Can take it for a short duration swim in a pool, under the shower or rain without any worries. Watch uppper body is brushed aluminium and under body is good quality plastic. The straps are soft and also of very good quality. It doesn't irritate your skin even after wearing it for long durations. Four colour options are available with equally matching straps.. Straps can be easily replaced with fancy straps.
12 ) Works both with Android and iPhone flawlessly. Tested on both.

TIPs AND TRICKs ________________________________________

1) Boat wave app needs to run in the background all the time for your call notifications, message notifications, Alexa functionality and Weather updates. If you accidentally clear all the cache and background apps from the phone, the watch will disconnect from the phone after some time when idle ( no active inputs probably after 10-15 mins). Keep the boat wave app running in the background. Most people complaining that the watch frequently disconnected might unintentionally be clearing all the background apps. My watch was continuously connected for 4 straight days without me having to reconnect as long as the boat wave app was running in the background.

2) Alexa on this watch can do a lot of things..It can set your alarms, start the stopwatch, show weather, control Alexa based devices like Echo, wireless lights and AC, work as a simple calculator, translate simple/ short English sentences to German, Spanish, Italian, French and Portugese, get you common stock quotes from internet, can you snippets of general information from the internet in case you don't know something. Yes, Alexa on your watch getting you the information is a little slow, takes about 30 -40 seconds to process your request but it's convenient and better that taking out the phone from your pocket which might take similar amount of time or longer. In my personal experience, Alexa works a little faster on Android as compared to iphone ( maybe 2-3 second difference). Also if there is break while speaking or if there is a long sentence, then it's difficult for Alexa to understand.. Check my video.. Keep it short and you should get the results accurately
3) For Alexa to work properly: After connecting the Boat Wave app with an Amazon account, download the Alexa app and check your Xtend watch is visible under Devices option.
4) To pickup and make calls handsfree without using the phone, just use a Bluetooth headset with voice assistant function. It will work as a charm. The speaker function on most smart watches is useless as it's not convenient for calls while traveling or in a crowded place due to low volume and obviously you don't want everyone to hear your private conversation.. With voice assistant feature on your BT headset you can make a call or play music without having to touch your phone.

Few other functions which could have been provided and is missing. Actually available in many similarly priced devices :
1) Torch 🔦 - Makes the display bright white.. Comes handy in darkness.
2) Remote shutter button for camera.
3) Call silencing option could have been added.",['Best Budget watch']

 Most smartwatches and smartband offer more or less of similar functionalities except for the ones where we can take calls on the watch itself.

Bought this one for Rs.2999.

፨ Curved glass with anti-fingerprint coating,

፨ 9 sports mode - Walk, Yoga, Spin, Run, Climb, Workout, Bike, Hike, Treadmill.

---------------------
🗓️ MY USAGE
---------------------
፨ At just 35g weight and 22mm TPU band makes this band the very comfortable to wear. Also the strap is skin friendly and I didn’t get allergy with sweat on this band.
፨ The straps is easy to swap and replace if required and uses the spring pin type.
፨ The charging is a magnetic ping type and there is no need to remove straps or do anything. I felt this type of charging the easiest of all.
፨ The looks is very premium, though is made up of polycarbonate, the grey and black colors, the curved display on the sides and the size make it look like an Apple Watch.
፨ There are only 5 of watch faces and some of them are like the Apple watch face design. As of now the watch faces are limited and customization is limited, I hope customizations will be made available.
፨ The display is beautiful and under direct sunlight I found the watch display visible, though not the best visibility but to a certain extent.
፨ There is 1 button the side which looks like the watch crown and it acts as the function button and return button. I found it easy to navigate using the touch display and using this button.
፨ The IP68 certification means now I I don't have to worry about protection from water even more than 1m depth (IP_8) and also no need to worry about dirt (IP6_).
፨ Health, fitness and sleep tracking is very accurate in my opinion, and surprisingly the NoiseFit sport app is also good. The breathe is just to take a break and just asks us to take a deep breathe. I found using a continuous heart rate sensor get the battery under 7 days and when this feature is turned off, it takes to almost 10 days.
፨ The sleep, heart rate and health tracking are pretty accurate in my opinion. Most of the features available in smart bands and basic smart watches were available.
፨ I can now read messages and notification from the band easily. From the app I was able to turn off and on what notifications need to be shown on the watch and notifications can be enabled for vibrations.
፨ There are some quick access shortcuts from the watch like find my phone, turn off/on continuous heart rate monitoring, Do not Disturb, wrist. The female health care feature of menstrual cycle and ovulations cycle is a nice add in my opinion.

💖 WHAT I LIKED
-------------------------
◾ The premium design and great display. Much better than other smartwatches and bands in this category in my opinion.
◾ Battery life of 7 to 10 days.
◾ IPX68 dust and waterproof.
◾ Pretty accurate fitness, health and sleep monitoring
◾ Better control & display of calls, messages and music from the band

-------------------------------------------------
♻️ WHAT I FELT CAN BE IMPROVED
-------------------------------------------------
◾ More exercise or activities could have been included like Badminton etc.
◾ Only 5 watch faces available but heard there will be more added this year.

Second thing i loathe is that, the back cover is a fingerprint magnet. Some kind of resin or composite material is used.

Pros:
Battery - Battery backup is a fantastic feature of this phone. One day full use drained only 29% 😀.
The phone is too lightweight ☺️ and very handy😄
Not felt any heating issue while charging and after long hours of usage. 😃.

Cons :
All apps are lagging.
Camera - The camera quality is poor, both front and back camera. 😭
GPU - Graphics processor PowerVR GE820 can't draw even a single circle properly. 😠😠.
High-quality video & image rendering are also unsatisfactory.
Processor - Mediatek Helio G25 is processor is not sufficient for this phone. 😥. Not feeling the benefits of 2GHz clock speed.
Display - Size of the display is quite good 👍But it has only 267 PPI. Even Redmi 4A (released in Nov 2016) has 296 PPI. 😠
Display quality is too poor. 😫 Very cheap quality display.

Ignorable Missing features -
No fingerprint sensor. 🥺
No led in front of the display.😰

Major Missing features -
No gorilla glass protection 😥

If you planning to buy a phone within a low budget you can choose the next segment of phones with HelioG35 or above🤗 with at least above 290 PPI.

Before that day I left the phone at 50% while going to sleep and in the morning it was 38%. Its definitely a defect with such a low standby time for a new device. There's no point in 30 minutes fast charge if the drain is that fast.

The mobile does exceedingly well in all departments ( I am not a gamer though and havent tested for gaming)

I uninstalled and disabled all bloat ware and i dont see any annoying notifications

By the way, my screen did scratch up when pulling out of my jeans pocket. I had to put a screen guard that masks that scratch. Need to take extra care as compared to my older OnePlus.

I have been using this phone for a week and overall i am satisfied. Looks and finishing off the phone is good. Camera is impressive but don't get carried away by the""professional photography"" tagline. Coming from a OnePlus phone that I used for a solid 4+years, I can't help but compare...
Definitely needs a better case, don't even think of using without case as the phone is slippery.
Also, the speakers are a bit of a let down but ok for practical purposes.
Too much intrusion by vivo software is also annoying but not a deal breaker of you know how to restrict unwanted apps permissions.
Regarding battery, I have nothing to complain as the trade-off for sleek design and a usable form factor, it should get you through a day unless you spend more than 6 hours on phone.

But let me tell you, this phone is built like a tank and will definitely survive the regular day-to-day usage without any hiccups. Don't remove the pre-installed screen guard though as recommended by Samsung.

I love the way it feels so compact in my pocket, and having a super vibrant and big screen when unfolded. You will definitely notice the crease is the middle, but honestly I got used to it within hours of usage. The cover screen is super helpful for quick notification checks and most importantly it really helped me reduce my excessive screen-on time from social media. The speakers are great and give good stereo simulation. Cameras are decent for daily use (that cover screen view finder really helps taking great selfies).

Best part of flip 3 is the table top mode, where in I no longer need to think about where to keep my phone while watching videos during meals or running daily errands. You can force this mode over any app and make the most out of it.

At last, lets address the elephant in the room, the battery life. Yes, it is not that great but if you don't mind switching back to 60Hz from 120Hz during daily usage, it would easily last a day. Also, 15 watts might not be very fast, but initial charging speed is great (at least upto 30% battery) which helps a lot. Wireless charging works flawlessly and is very convenient as the phone is super compact and there is no hit/miss on the charging dock.

Overall, I am super satisfied with the purchase, if you are looking for a phone which really makes you stand out of the crowd, having decent cameras and practically super helpful with hands-free content-viewing and video calling, just go for Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G.

19482,1,I have purchased this phone and just 2 months after minimal use the screen gets a white line and it didn't do anything it happens overnight . I have visited the service center to get it checked and they said it's can't be replaced under warranty and you have to spend 45k to get it replaced. It's my biggest mistake on purchasing mobile that I choose this phone just because of the new fold technology. See I'm genuinely requesting to not purchase its a waste of money. I also request samsung to understand the flaws of the mobile and support your users.,"[""Don't Buy!! Screen will damage automatically after few months""]"

Be ready of people noticing the phone and approaching you regarding phone name and details etc. Good decision by Samsung to embed Snapdragon 888. A lot of reviews are flooded with comments regarding not very good battery backup but it is understandable considering how compact the phone is and in my experience it is manageable. Not great but not worst like iPhone 12 mini/ iPhone SE either. Camera is impressive as the primary cameras can be used to take selfies as well and the screen is just WOW. You will love it 100%.

I got it for 6299 Rs in big billion sale.
For the price, it's display is bright and good quality. It has type C port which is exciting.(i found out later that it's not type c) 5000 mah battery. 18 W charging. Processor is good for mid graphics games like hill climb racing and few shooting games. It can play pubg but you won't enjoy it much. It can handle day to day apps like Whatsapp, facebook, instagram, chrome, youtube without any lag or heating. Camera is average but for this price it's good. Clickable pictures.
It has realme ui which is features loaded. Best UI. I have 3 realme phones and updates are never delayed. Hence company really backup product after sales.

I am not a gamer. So can't say about the gaming performance. But for those who are buying it for normal usage, this phone is great for one year. With 6gb ram,128 GB internal storage and Amoled display I was more than satisfied TILL ONE YEAR.

After the one year and two month mark the phone started to automatically restart and freeze every 5 minutes of usage. Went to Samsung care and they said the motherboard has issues and need to be replaced and asked me to pay Rs 8000 since the warranty period was over. To my surprise the issue was not only with my phone. Many M21 buyers had the same issue, although some were lucky enough to have replaced the motherboard in warranty period.

So my point is this phone is not a Rs 14499 phone instead it is a Rs 14499 + Rs 8000 phone if you want it to use it more than 1 year. In brief it is a Rs 22499 phone. You can get better phones in this price range.

1. MUX SWITCH- Yes it is there
2. It is cool literally! I played GTA max settings at 1080p resolution and thermals were superb! The best I have ever seen.
3. I don't know about HDR gaming but the display supports HDR video.
4. Earlier I thought the Optane memory is occupying a second SSD slot but apparently they are using Intel Optane H10 Solid State Drive HBRPEKNX which is a hybrid drive so the second SSD slot is free!
5. RTX 3060 is 100 watts
6. 180 degree hinge! and thin chasis with beautiful classy looks!!! It's very subtle

Cons-
1. Okay it is expensive. I won't say overpriced but it is expensive..
2. Speakers are okay not bad just okay
3. Storage.. well 512 GB with user accessible storage of 477 GB only.... Just GTA V is 104 GB in Epic games!

OLD REVIEW-
Okay, let's talk about the Intel Optane memory here... Which is paired with an SSD.. Really HP? An Optane memory is to be paired with an HDD, an SSD is sufficient in itself! There is no need for the Intel Optane memory, so instead HP could have added an additional SSD and since the Intel Optane memory takes the same slot as an SSD to expand storage with an additional SSD it means to replace the existing Intel Optane Memory. I believe Omen is aimed at gamers and gamers desire performance and Intel Optane memory doesn't increase performance at all!! And then is the meager 512GB SSD! This is like the last nail in the coffin, a gaming machine with a price tag of 1.35 L Indian currency! Really HP? I guess they don't know what is the size of games these days... This is highly unexpected from HP, it's more like intentionally selling Intel hardwares. I am not commenting anything on i7-10870H, AMD competition has better performance but then the intel optane memory... Sounds a tad bit fishy... Anyways I would not recommend to buy this for the current price tag and atleast not since HP hasn't mentioned the TDP of RTX3060 officially, it is rumoured to be 100Watts but it's just a rumour since HP has various configurations with different TDP for similar graphics card. Overall this entire model seems fishy... It's definitely not worth the money!",['AMAZING laptop just a little overpriced..']

19592,5,"This is a laptop that I purchased after extensive research and hundreds of hours of watching YT reviews on the latest laptops. I wanted something that was future proof for at least the next 7 years but light on my pocket.

I did not want fancy good looking thin and light laptops with fancy features like windows hello face recognition, 24-hour battery life, Thunderbolt 4. These are good features to have but I did not want them on my laptop. The main purpose of this laptop was school work, light programming, consuming entertainment and seamless web browsing. Particularly, I wanted the office applications to open quickly and get work done soon, instead of waiting for them to load forever.

This laptop delivered everything I wanted. It is a no-nonsense laptop. Performs exactly as I expected. The application opening is snappy. The response times for web browsing are super crisp. Installations take barely any time. The web download and upload speeds are impressive. Some pros and cons for your consideration below.

Pros:
-Built like a tank, sturdy, no flex on screen, the body is hard with minimal keyboard flex
-Typing experience is good with good keys layout, awesome special keys at the top row
-Trackpad is large enough and very responsive, buttery smooth pinch-zoom just like a mac
-Screen is large with barely any bezels (just about 1 cm chin)
-The top lid is metal and feels premium (attracts fingerprints though)
-Processor and ram performance are on point
-The wifi connection stability is consistent and has high speed
-Applications open swiftly and boot time is within 7 seconds
-Fingerprint sensor has <1 second response time (the best I have seen)
-Hinge is plastic but sturdy and it will last long
-Screen brightness is good, suited for my purpose
-Seamless integration into a wireless display
-Lenovo vantage software keeps things updated and allows easy management of the laptop
-MS office setup was easy
-McAfee Full version cost just 299 extra
-Type C USB port for display or power delivery

Cons
-Webcam is poor (you may want to use an external camera, no windows hello face recognition)
-Screen resolution could have been better
-Sound is loud but has a tin like quality as if coming from a hollow. The sound is sufficient for casual use/online class but you may want to use a earphone anyways
-Slightly heavier (can lift with one hand), probably due to the build quality
-Botton cover is plastic (but a high-quality one with no plasticky feeling), feels rubberised surface
-No dedicated GPU like MX450 in this model (other variations of this laptop have GPU but they do not have 16GB ram)
-Battery lasts for 7 hours or less on regular surfing (a 70Whr battery would have been nicer instead of the 57 Whr)
-Charger is small but the conventional type. Instead, I would have liked a single brick USB type C charger (like the mac).

Final recommendation: This is the laptop for everyday use for everyone, where you don't have to worry about being careful with it (like a mac). It will take care of you. The Cons mentioned above are minor quibbles from a perfectionist but to be balanced in my review I had to point them out.

Get work done without the distraction of fancy features. Will recommend this laptop for price-conscious power users who just want some peace of mind with their laptop and work. Get the three years warranty for extra peace.",['Budget Laptop with Awesome Performance']

19616,5,"Update 1:
Turn off hybrid mode in Lenovo software if you are connected to power always. This will need restart every time you change. It slightly increases fps and it frees 2GB of ram. With hybrid mode on you only get 13.9GB ram since AMD graphics uses ram as vram.

Bought this only 1 day ago. This laptop plays every game above 60 fps even in balanced mode. Tested with GTA V and Horizon zero dawn with a QHD external monitor. Built in display is FHD.

CPU and GPU:
Ryzen 5800h and rtx 3060. Nothing to tell they work great on games running in balanced mode makes the laptop quiet. Performance mode will be needed only for recent AAA games like RDR2 and Cyberpunk. 6GB VRAM is my only concern as many games use 5.2GB already. But it is still future proof for atleast 2-3 years to play on ultra textures in 1080p.

Display:
FHD 165hz with Dolby vision. Display is great.

SSD:
It has 2TB SSD. Two SSDs of 1 TB each. It is hard to get at this price. It is the most important and distinguishable feature of this laptop at this price.
Test file size: 8GB
Seq read: 3.4GB
Seq write: 2.8GB

Battery:
In gaming I don't use battery. It shows 2 hours after removing power. But without gaming doing my work it goes more than 6 hours. I'll update exactly how long it takes later.

Ram:
2x8GB rams. It's x16 you would have seen this already in YouTube reviews if not search ""Jarrod's tech"" on YT. I don't know how much it impacts since I don't have any problem on gaming. The only game I know which needs more than 16GB is star citizen you have to replace these 2 rams by 2x16GB cards.

Package:
Below average. It's just a cardboard and a laptop inside it. Offcourse Amazon had two more packages on top of it for protection so it is safe.

Conclusion:
It is better than 5 pro or any Asus laptop at this price. 5 pro has QHD display that's the majar difference. For me it is not worth the premium as the performance is only slightly higher.",['Best bang for your buck']

19620,4," Great specs and deal by Amazon + hdfc during great Indian festival sale. I would keep it short and simple. Since i am a techie from mechanical background, i wanted a laptop for using software (graphic intensive) and venturing into machine learning and deep learning. This machine has Nvidia RTX 3050, it works flawless for such software.

I am not an avid gamer but I do play time over. I precisely feel it is decent at the best for handling almost all games, haven't tested any heavy GPu intensive ones but I believe there are tons of video on internet on RTX 3050 gaming.

Pros-
1. All-rounded machine for every task. RTX series is good for graphic intensive software. If you are into cad and design software. This could be a great budget machine.
2. Crisp display - 165 hz panel with dolby support and 100% sRGb is incredible. Colors are vibrant and screen is consistent. Great for editing videos,photos and designing.
3. Multicore performance of amd 7 series is exceptional and it comes with shared 2 gb v ram for amd radeon graphics which is a plus.
4. Lastly the build quality of the machine is minimalistic yet with an element of legion. Blue chasis, keyboard is great, mouse trackpad is responsive.

Cons -
1. No screen refresh rate change. It comes wigh 165 hz which has a downside of draining battery. Hybrid mode and quiet mode can help but we can't pull out 4 hours of continuous usage off single charge. There is no way to change it to 60 hz. My earlier laptop dell g5 was pretty efficient i am surprised 6-7 hours it had on a single charge.
2. Webcam is pretty average. Not really a con but people might have to attend meetings with it.
3. Support by lenovo legion ultimate is pretty ordinary. They charge premium price. After sales services of dell is the best.",['Gaming machine with pretty darn good display!']

2. Cooling: I'm super impressed, I didn't expect it to be this good, stays at a comfortable 70C for light games like Valorant, CS:GO and handles heavy games really well as well.
3. Display: It's a beautiful display, no issues whatsoever. The 165Hz is a treat to look at.
4. Keyboard & touchpad: Pretty good, I use an external keyboard and mouse so it works for me.
5. Speakers: Average, not the best but does the job, doesn't matter if you use headphones always like me.
6. Camera: As good as you can expect from a 720p gaming laptop camera, does the job.
7. Software: Win 11 is kind of buggy but nothing that won't get fixed in the future hopefully. Lenovo Vantage is not fun to use at all, wish it was better. You should probably have Hybrid mode off to get better performance but at the cost of battery and switching it back on requires a restart. Also recommend not using Network boost, it's garbage and causes insane packet loss while streaming.
8. Battery: 80 Whr, good capacity and you can squeeze 4hrs out of it on aggressive battery saving methods. It's a gaming laptop so no complaints, it's on the better side of battery lives.
9. Build: Feels very premium, looks minimalistic, hinge seems to be good, ports at the back to keep wires out of sight, love the absence of ""gamer"" accents most laptops have these days.",['Got this model at 1.18 lakh after ICICI cashback (Thanks to @gamingsetupdeals on Telegram)']

19630,2,"Ok the DSLR Giant Canon have launched 1 more entry level DSLR. Actually i bought this camera for my friend. Does this camera worth 31K. Lets see

PROS
1. Its easy to use
2. Decent battery backup
3. Live mode operation is not lagging.

CONS
1. While focusing the DSLR is making too much noise and its the kind of annoying that u will lose interest in taking photos.
2. No shortcut or assigned button to change F stop (aperture). A manufacturer who is keeping dedicated button for changing the ISO have to thing about the importance of aperture.
3. You can't change the focusing point by pressing the round dial in the system, if u press it some other setup will open up.
4. The output image quality is actually not mind blowing.
5. White balance- Use it if u want to take risk
6. Main issue. If u use camera flash to snap a pic during focusing it will flicker like anything and it will annoy and irritate the subject
7. Noise Noise Noise. Whatever low ISO you use noise will b there and when i went to service center to ask about this they were saying use a prime lens to get good output.
I am a Nikon user i have Nikon D3400. I compared both cameras by taking same images with same settings in manual mode. The output from Nikon is better than Canon 1500D.
In one word if want to push photography to next level from using a Point and Shoot or mobile camera to DSLR Or to learn the whole DSLR setting go for it (only with a mindset to change the camera in 1 or 2 years). As canon accessories are comparatively less costly than Nikon it wont create hole in ur pocket.

Easy to operate compared to Nikkon models.
Fast moving subjects cannot be captured as expected due to its poor auto focus performance. It take about 3 to 6 seconds to focus in internal lighting conditions and it fail to focus several times in dim lights.

19640,4,"I got this camera after seeing rave reviews in YouTube. However, this review will focus on the shortcomings only. I discovered after 10 days of use.
1. Poor battery life : does not last even 3 hours of use. However, this is compensated by the extra battery provided. But the way battery compartment is designed does no good to the purpose. you need to unscrew from mount to change The battery. So you will need to break your schedule in case u are shooting something continuous.
2. Error Error - the dreaded E:62:10 error appeared in my camera after few days of use. Although I did not face any difficulty in shooting. It did make my experience bitter. Could not resolve though the solutions available on internet. The usual switch on of. Change battery etc does not work and the error message is a part of the display now.
3. Mic : even tough the mic is a strong one. It does not do well to reduce background noise.
4. Charging time : 150 mins. This really restricts ur ability to shoot and u need to plan ahead if you are a serious vlogger.
5. Not weather proof. : the manual says it is not weather proof and small amounts of water may damage the internal circuits. I mean why? It restricts your ability to take outdoor shoot and a vlogger would not take this.

Apart from the above. The camera delivers what it promises in the review videos.

Update :
My lens assembly was faulty. Thankfully Sony service centre was open and as directed by the Sony representative, I gave the camera for repair. It took 14 days to get the part from abroad and complete the repairs. Now, the camera is working fine. No issues as such.
Update 2: Please go through the settings and understand each setting before shooting. There are a lot of helpful YouTube videos on this camera.
Update 3 : The camera worked fine for 2 days after repairs. As of now it is still in the repair shop. 2 months after purchase the camera is 28 days.(and counting) in repair shop. Even after 2 trips of repair shop the error does not go away. Now it is a permanent display in my camera.

2) Battery 🔋 can't even hold a month if not using. Once I charge the device to full capacity it doesn't last a month on stand by. In case of emergency shoot it is not a good companion

I always confused between Canon m50 or Sony ZV1. Atleast choose the ZV1. Because of these resons,
1. Great Autofocus ( Very very useful. Sony cameras are very reliable)

2. Quality (Sony smashed Canon)

3. Less croped, usable 4k recording ( As compared to m50)

4. Low light capability (Much much better than m50)

5. Value for money ( I calculted overall cost to get the same things from M50, and it cost more than ZV1)

But, yes there have two major drawbacks,
1. Battery (Yes you'll get more battery life in m50 compared to ZV1)

2. 24mm lens ( I think 16mm is the best lens for vlogging and you can buy one for M50. For ZV1, yes it's 24mm is wide but not as much as you need for vlogging.)

19654,3,"In fact let me confess that I have been using all sorts of cameras , point and shoot, travel, high zoom, DSLR s for well over two decades. And as a compulsive camera buyer, i buy cameras without any rhyme or reason. So far I have been using either Canon or Nikon, but this time I decided to go for Sony.......

Recently my small canon point and shoot I had gifted to my friend and hence decided to go for Sony. I chanced upon SONY DCS W830 . I bought the camera on Amazon with very high hopes about the picture quality,ease of use,good optics, but frankly I am disappointed on following points about the camera. The delivery by Amazon is world-Class, super fast and with very good service.

Build quality is not up to the mark. you can feel it. The top plate on the camera which houses shutter and on-off button is very loose. My one day old camera is already showing that this plate may fall off anytime. Secondly , the buttons are so flush on the top plate that even before you struggle to find the button, it operates without you feeling it lock the focus. Even on-off button needs some effort to locate and switch on. In any camera half press shutter locks the focus This Camera locks the focus but even a slightly more pressure. on shutter releases the shutter, causing out of focus pics.

Picture quality initially looks good. But I may have to shoot under different conditions to verify that whether the picture quality is in keeping with SONY Quality. Which I believe is top class . Just now I downloaded few pics shot on this camera, and I found them to be of average quality.

I bought the camera for its Zeiss Lens, Sony's famous software, and the name sony is a guarantee in itself. I very well know that this particular camera is 5 year old model. and Sony may no longer be manufacturing this model, but if these are the deficiencies which persist, then why Sony is still market ting it. It may have adverse impact.

I also feel that one has to find out whether the product is genuine Sony or some sub-standard stuff is being palmed off as genuine sony product.

I will use it for few more days and write again on my experience about this camera.",['affordable small camera .........but']

Here this headphone wins. Perfect Bass. Also the vocals of the songs are great. No crackling noise or distortion at high volume. Sound would be lower even at 50% but that suits me. And the thing is, the sound was so good on using aux than bluetooth.

Bluetooth.
Decent range and the sound quality over bluetooth is good. Connects within 2 secs after on. So no problem here.

The ear pad are of memory foam, so you'll feel much great if you wear it. The earpad almost covers the ear (the inner dimensions are 60x40mm), not like partial over the ear headphones others sells. If you have used boat and switch to this, you'll fell it.
But Here comes the major drawback. This headphone does not allow air circulation. So you can easily get sweating ears and that too in this summer season, its a real trouble you can face (you cant wear for many hours continuosly).

And the headphones are ""not"" heavy, so won't give any head pain on long use. But they could have extended the headrest a little bit longer imo.

Noise cancellation.
It's provides passive noise cancellation only as it fully covers the ear. But At high volume, you won't hear most of the external sound for sure.

Mic quality.
It's good. Using for Microsoft teams, gmeet and calls. No problem heard from other person. So it's good. Note: you can't use mic on aux mode, for that you have to have bluetooth enabled pc or buy in-line mic aux cable.

Build quality.
Good. Matte plastic they have used So you will not get a cheap feeling. Its metal build over the driver and battery it seems (which is cold to touch most of the times) , I like it.

The headphone pouch they given is not so great (just for storage purpose nly.). It would cost nearly for 200rs that's all its worth. The aux cable is good and quite long enough. Charging cable also of good quality but short in length.

But I would admit, they have one of the best customer service. Cleared every doubt. Answered my every question by the next day itself. I appreciate that very much.

And you can even extend your warranty for extra one year by mailing them.

Overall, I would recommend this headphone, just a bit discomfort as cause sweating easily, but in other aspects, it is great. Imo, you can go for it.",['Detailed review after 1 week of usage. Must read!']
19693,5,"I'm giving the review after 1 month of trying and testing (also watched lot of yt and asked bunch of trusted friends) every single headphones under 5k range. This is by far the best headphones out of all of them.
I'm a rockhead and I listen to songs 2-3hrs a day so I really needed a headphones that can give a clear output and layering between drums, guitar, bass and vocals.
1. The sound is amazingly balanced its not super loud but its just perfectly loud, you won't feel dissatisfied.
2. You can hear as well as feel the bass it doesn't overpower other instruments.
3. The vocals are super clear
4. They are very lightweight and the earcups are so soft you can wear it as long as you want.
5. They also give you a classy case with it, I'm a rough user so its an added bonus.

So finally if you're looking for headphones under 2.5k I'll recommend the followings
1. Tribit xfree go for balanced sound good bass and great quality
2. Boat rockerz 550 if you need sheer loudness as they are the loudest in the price range but they literally have 0 bass so i returned it.
3. Soundcore q10, great quality, volume is the lowest out of all 3 hence i returned but the bass is probably the most out of all ( it does overpower other intruments so not my ideal choice) also they weigh like 200kg and u can't wear them for a long time.

19701,4,"Im going to give a small comparison of this product with two of the headphones i have been using recently.
This includes Samsung level u ( rs 2249/) and the ant audio w56 in ear wired earphone ( rs 599/)
Pros
Decent build quality
Excellent sound quality
Apt for watching movies.
Soft cushioning
Mic
Good quality cable
Cons
External noices creeps in a lot ( less noice cancellation effect).
Jack is not gold plated, but I won't complain about it because the gold plating on most of the jacks of headphones in this price range will wear off after a months usage.

On comparing the boat bass heads 900 with the ones mentioned above, I noticed that the bass levels were pretty much equal between the ant audio w56 and boat bass heads 900. Samsung level u has the least bass compared to the other 2
In terms of audio quality, the boat bass heads and Samsung level u are in the same level, the clarity of sound is a bit less in the ant audio w56 compared to the boat .
For outdoor use, I would prefer the ant audio w56 as it has better noice cancellation compared to the boat.
Comfort
I have read some reviews complaining about the boat bass heads 900 that it pains in the ears after a few minutes of usage. But I have not experienced such problems.
Build quality
The plastics used is not the best, but acceptable. Ear pads are well cushioned.
Summary
Overall a really decent product from boat, excellent sound clarity and good bass makes it good for watching movies. Most suitable for indoor usage, good value for money ( bought it for 799 but will be available for 599 at certain times.)

Tested audio at 60% volume which was pretty loud.

Pros -
1. Metallic Blue colour looks great
2. Braided cable from pin to the mic
3. Clean audio output and quite loud
4. Bass is not too overwhelming - Just right for hiphop / EDM / bollywood / rock - tested with Badshah's / Maroon 5 / Clean Bandit / Michael Jackson songs (over time i have seen these songs are the ones which can show how good your speakers are). Treble is not too bright and sounds just right.
5. Tested with old Kishore songs and the output sounded very nice and full (non processed)
6. Tested with only instrumentals like Kenny Boney James - Sounded great as if played from an amplifier with subs.

Cons -
1. The braided cable color combination could look better with blue and black
2. The portion from the mic to the earphones if also braided would enhance the otherwise good build
3. Price i bought it for is 499/- however a price of 399/- would be more appropriate for this item
4. A pouch or a small carry case would be a great addon to this if at a price of 499/-

I feel most people complaining about their branded headphones failing sooner than expected is because of using them on PCs and playing audio/video using applications like VLC which have audio amplifiers which burn the speaker coil over extended use. Suggest using other players and avoiding any sound enhancers etc on phones or PCs

NOTE: I am not comparing with the likes of Sennheiser \ Audiotechnica \ JVC \ JBL \ Bose \ BeatsAudio \ Sony - all of these brands are pretty good when it comes to audio signatures and separation but they also come at a much more premium cost.",['Good build - Clean audio quality !! Enhanced Bass']

The midtones are rich but I wish the headphones had better bass. The HD microphone is good for audio calls but there is no background noise cancellation.

19722,4,"Well, this review is coming from a qualified audio engineer. I bought this and got what I was expecting from a cheap set of earphones with lot of hype around the quality that it offers. So anyone who is not a purist or an audiofile, can definitely go for it. Best would be to keep your EQ flat and suspend all other sound enhancements on your device. Dolby Atmos modes work quite well though for movies.

Ok, now the sour truth abiut quality if you care. Come on guys, this earphone says it is high res certified. But I could tell right away, the quality which I was expecting (being greedy and stingy) from a high res audio capable earphones, was way so much more than what this had to offer. Again, I am happy that whatever I could get is not to regret because the price I paid is way too much less to get that quality in return. The high frequency in briliance part of the spectrum is just a little disappointing. Low mids are a tad too tinny sounding. Extreme lows are impressive though and anything below 50Hz does make the diaphragms make some noise, which sounds like distortion in music. I think prolonged listening to low bass at high volumes will shorten the life of the earohones because of overheating of thise tiny voice coils. So try and avoid extremely bass boosted tracks at high volumes.

Vocals are not full, and sounds a little hollow, cross talks with low mids and high mids.

Dynamic range handling is good.

Cable with silicon finish when hitting your body while you wear this and walk does transfer vibrations to your ears. But if you are not moving, the sound is just fine. Passive noise cancellation is decent enough.

All in all, the price is justified for the quality. I would surely recommend this product for day to day average music listening and casual video watching on smartphones. This will not disappoint you. But if you are an audio professional, well I need not say it but we all know, quality never comes cheap!

19728,5,"I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.

SOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!

The sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.

BATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.

CONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.

MIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.

LATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).

COMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.

I think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.

19737,4,"I bought this headphone on prime day sale for 1500/- . For this price range these are really good. I will divide this review between pros and cons.
Pros:
1. Unboxing experience was good it has every basic thing aux wire and cable for charging.
2 . Build quality: This is the best feature of these headphone. The pads are quite comfy . It was little on heavier side but distribution of weight is good, it does not feel heavy on use. The buttons are made of plastic but they felt tactile. Overall it looks sturdy
3 . Great design , as portrayed in the picture. The patterned pads gives premium feel.
4 . Sound quality : The most important part of any audio product. I am no audiophile but i have tried several budget products and some high end products ober years so this might be helpful
The balance of sound is good , the songs appear pleasing with a accentuated lows . It will do wonders if you like heavy bass.
The mids aren't that great and sometimes they felt crushed by the overpowering bass. Instrument seperation is good and one can make out different instrument playing in the background but again they are little overpowered by bass. I know this is asking too much but boat should give a manual controller to decrease the bass like skullcandy crusher. Highs are above avg and the experience was quite enjoyable when when we were listening songs. When I was watching movies I could make out the dialogues spoken by the characters and the movie watching experience was quite enjoyable too . Overall it's a great sound experience for the price .

5. Battery : No complaints here ! Great battery life . I don't know the actual backup but it lasted a week after charging it fully.

6. it connected to my phone pretty easily and the there was no drop in connection even if I move a little away from the phone.

Cons
1. The bass is little overpowering for my liking. If you can tweak using equilizer then you can find the perfect balance between all three mids highs and lows.
2. It has micro-usb in 2020 which is little outdated.
3. The buttons could have been a little better and while turning on the headphones there is a voice which says turned on sound is little loud even when you decrease volume.

19738,4,"Hey guys,
I got these earphones and I used it thoroughly in every sense like I tested battery time, charging time,sound quality, connectivity,etc. So let's start with pros.
Pros:
This is a boat product so I expecting to be in great sounding and it did. It's sound quality is like best at its price segment and better than high priced product too.
It fits into the ear like perfect fitting. It will not come out even you swing your head hardly.
It has a decent look that doesn't even get noticed like very subtle.
Its mic quality is also decent.
And now for what you have come so far
Cons:
It shows of having a battery life upto 8 hours but it doesn't giving even 5 hours of continuous use.
Its bluetooth connectivity is also poor. It's connection get blocked by a single wall. That means you can't use it in your home but if you use it in open place,you will get a range of 10 m.
Its mic sound get distortion at the other end when you are on a call.
It got a very bad phrases which interupt your music which I heard most people are complaining.
It got some bad software sync with your phone. Like you charged it, you are using it and it doesn't show a battery drop after use and you think that it giving a great battery life but its not. That level drop drastically like from 100 to 50 directly and then you think that its a defected piece but its not. So this is also a issue.
And at last, when you are on call it cut little sound from the other side like blocking signals. Its the earphone issue.

Now conclusion,
If you want to get a great sounding earphone, go for 550 pro/sport which come at same price.
All in one word, I am not recommending these as you can't buy this only for sound.
And you can get my point from the above mentioned issues.

🚩 BOAT is a confused Indian brand which is selling basically the same BT Headsets with slight exterior variations into many models !

🚩 The BT 5.2 Connectivity is instant & hassle-free ! NO LAG/LATENCY as such. PAIR IT WITH A GOOD PHONE & YES YOU CAN PLAY PUBG/BGMI. 👍🏻
🚩 the Material Quality is Premium & the choice of plastic + rubber is very diligently used. The earcups snugs into your ears nicely.

🚩 The Sound Quality is acceptable. Also the UNI-DIRECTIONAL Mic is loud & crystal clear during Calls 📞.

🚩 Don't expect Apple Airpods/Samsung Buds type of experience but the Sound Stage is decent. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR 👍🏻",['DETAILED UNBAISED REVIEW BELOW ❤']

19752,4,"lets get directly into the Pros & Cons :-

sry it will be a long review coz the review have to be useful for everyone who plans to buy this.

Pros:-
* The Price, given to this price bracket its the best one i can suggest from the built quality to the Audio quality its superior for the price 499/- (i got for this price tag)

*then the Comfort, everybody complaining about the earpads i dont know why, if your going for over the ear type u have to be known that u cant wear it all day long the most expensive products also tend to warm your ears and get a little uncomfortable, so if its not preffered u can go for earphones or earbuds. as i bought multiple ober the ear headphones there will be rought cloth like texture that will irritate your ears, But this One has SOFT CUSHION like material, im really comfortable with this one.

*and next the Audio Quality, i have previosuly owned boult in-ear earphones so i know the bass quality and vocal quality, so i booked this without even thinking twice, and it has delivered what it can. the best part is im really comfortable in this one than my in-ear earphones, the sound is even better and you dont get high volume levels like those local cheap products on the markets. but the Bass and Clarity will give you some extra feel, especially the BASS.. its really engaging, if ur a Bass lover go for it.

*then the Quality, i know the Boult for sometime but for over the ear headphones at this price point i was little skeptical about the build quality before the delivery and it suprised me, dont think that build quality is extraordinary like sennheiser or Sony coz ur not paying that much for this, so for this price its so good, even better than the boat headphones which is slightly high in the price tag.

Now Cons:-

* little skeptical about the Warranty, because when i gone to register this and both while i was registered my boult in-ear earphones, they didnt asked for Invoice slips and No serial number is asked, then how can they proceed if we call for the warranty claims?... but hopefully i think this will last long as seeing the quality.

* Next is the Cable Quality, i didnt complaining about it, but they mentioned in amazon as its an Kevlar Cable, so i expected a lott but its a normal cable bt its Sturdy enough.

*** i didnt check the mic on it, i make a call on this, the other person was able to understand me, but i dont know hows the quality.

To Help you guys, i have metioned every aspect in detailed manner so it can helpful for people who spend their valuable money (coz every single rupee counts)..

Have a Nice and Safe Shopping. Bye☺️",['Detailed Review & Pros and Cons !!!']

19758,1,"I first owned a Bose QC35, however, I felt Bose was not innovating in terms of sound control and technology. This led me to buy the Sony WH-1000XM2 which I used for over a year without any trouble. I was completely happy with them. When Sony released Sony WH-1000XM3, I took the plunge and bought them in November 2018. After a month of using them, I began to hear crackling noises from the ear cups. I ignored them thinking they were some issue with the Bluetooth connection. This issue pursued and the noises became so unbearable that when they randomly came up, I had to immediately remove the headset from my wearing. At this point, I decided to Google the issue and was shocked to see that this was a common issue in most Sony WH-1000XM3.

Most of the above issues came up in the warranty period and most, if not everyone had their headsets replaced, however, the shocking part is that many complain that the issues persisted in the new headsets too. Looking at the bright side and the brand name, I was very confident that a new Firmware release would fix everything and just as I thought, there was soon a release, although the issue was not listed, I was hopeful. The new Firmware release did not fix the issue.I still could not get the headsets to the service centre, as I had a long journey coming up, I was considering to use them and then take them to service after my trip, only because the sounds were random and sometimes, they did not show up for a day or two. This was not to be and all of a sudden, the headsets died on me, they would show up in the connection but they would not respond or play music. I tried multiple devices with no luck. It was time to make a trip to the service centre.

5th February 2019 (Day 1) I reach Pranank Electronics Sony Authorised Service Centre at around 10. The place is a mess and the receptionist was at her lethargic best, but I believe, she was not trained to handle customers. I asked if I could speak with a technician, when she heard my problem, she just asked for an invoice and my headset, registered a complain and assured me there was no need to speak with anyone as this is a 100% non-repairable product and I will receive a replacement in 7 Days. Feeling upbeat about what she said, I left and went about my business.

6th February 2019 (Day 2)

I call up Pranank Electronics Sony Authorised Service Centre as a follow up as, on hindsight, I did not believe something could be so simple in India. I spoke with the same lady and she put me on hold and asked their technician about the status. She confirmed, the Sony WH-1000XM3 was dead and a request for replacement has been placed. I asked her if they needed to send this dead Sony WH-1000XM3 for a replacement or if the replacement will arrive without this process being done.

12th February 2019 (Day 7)

I call Pranank Electronics Sony Authorised Service Centre and was told they did not have an update for me. They asked me to call the Sony Toll Free number. I visit the website and raise an escalation case using my job number. I receive a response within hours. I also get a call from Pranank Electronics Sony Authorised Service Centre mentioning they had a call from their regional office and that they were being pressurised into trying different firmware's, the technician who spoke with me also mentioned that they are preparing an internal firmware which did not have a public release yet and wants to try that and see if that will fix my Sony WH-1000XM3. I was shocked to hear that everyone was working hand in hand and I was told, the local guys were getting pressure from above to keep me at bay. This really is a trust breaker on a brand such as Sony, I bought my Sony WH-1000XM3 for around Rs. 30,000 and after facing issues and bringing a dead set within 90 days and here we are where they are trying to just about make it work and give it back to me.

22nd February 2019 (Day 18)

As I was travelling for the 10-day gap, I could not really get in touch with them and neither my local service centre or Sony tried to get in touch with me to give me an update. I called Pranank Electronics. The technician was nice enough to inform me that the effort to not give a replacement and fix the existing one was still on. Now that they determined the problem was a faulty motherboard and they were waiting to determine the part number so could order it in. I have no words to describe this deceit. On one hand, I was told that this is a non-repairable item by every person I spoke to representing Sony and on the other hand here we are where they are trying every possible manner to just make it work and dump it on me.I write to Sony, but no response. I explain that I do not want a repair and want a replacement.

23rd February 2019 (Day 19)I write to Sony, but no response.

25th February 2019 (Day 21)

Sony writes back acknowledging that efforts to repair the item are no longer in place and they have placed an order for a headset. We would like to inform you that, we have placed an order for headset and we are arranging the stock from our sources. We assure you that care is taken to ensure the service as early as possible. We assure you that care is taken to ensure the product is delivered as early as possible.

6th March 2019 (Day 30)

I write a follow up as it has been over 10 days since they placed the order. I begin to wonder if they are looking for a refurbished piece of junk to dump it on me.No response.8th March 2019 (Day 32)I write to them. No response.

12th March 2019 (Day 36)

I call Pranank Electronics but no one picks up. I try thrice over an hour, but no one picks up. I call Sony on their Toll-Free number. The person picks up, does not apologize, treats it just like normal. I ask when I will have my headset and I am informed that she will expedite it and I will get the replacement headset by the end of this week, which will be  16th March. Sony also has an online option to find the status of the job which is literally useless and give random results. At the moment, it displays that the product has been serviced.

14th March 2019 (Day 38)

I received a call from Pranank Electronics informing me that the replacement has arrived and I can pick it up. It has to be seen how this replacement works or if they have given a brand new set or a refurbished one.

15th March 2019 (Day 39)

Upon reaching Pranank Electronics, I was shocked to see that there were massive letters written with a sketch on the box of the headsets. I was under the assumption that these were new. To my surprise, they had repaired my headsets and were giving me back my headsets and not a replacement as promised right from day one. I called the manager of the store and he had no clue about this replacement promise that his staff and the sony centre had made. I called Sony care on the toll-free number. The person who picked up the call had no clue what was going on but did acknowledge that a replacement request was placed. I explained and refused to take the repaired headset, he asked me to hand over the phone to the service centre staff. I had no idea what he spoke but he finally told me that I will be getting a call from the service centre and that he was escalating my case with utmost priority. I was terribly disappointed.

I am not sure how long this will go on for but I am having a nightmare with these, the reason I refuse to take a repaired headsets is because of their short lifetime and also because I was explicitly told that these were a non-repairable product and somehow they have repaired them.","['Do not buy these, read my experience!!']"
19759,5,"This is my FIRST Noise Cancellation Headphones! So NOT AN Expert opinion :P

-) Noise Cancellation is like using a tight In-Ear headphones But this is more comfortable
-) This will block external noise like AC, FAN, Rain etc. Block means not 100% but 80 to 90%!
-) If you play music! You will not hear anything from outside world! (As I said an In-Ear headphones do the same but it will be slightly painful)
-) A tight In-Ear headphones are not a replacement for Built in Noise Cancellation! I just point it out to the people who never experienced a Noise Cancellation headphones in life. This Noise Cancellation is Another level. You will only believe it when you actually get a chance to use it. NO YouTube reviews will give you the real experience.

This Noise Cancellation Headphones is useful WHEN

- I watch youtube videos / tutorials
- I write code
- I brainstorming
- I travel
- I go to bed and hear some songs before sleep
- I need to disconnect from the annoying world! around me :)

Battery life is really good. USB-C means one less cable, Fast charging is good!, Touch control is awesome, if you put right hand to right ear cup you can come back to the world you are in. it is a huge plus, when mom are dad call me! all I need to do is put my hand on the right ear cup!

Overall this NC Headphone Improved my life! Here is how.

- Now I can focus more on my work
- Less distraction from external noise (It is not 100% But 99% of the time it is 100%)
- I hate travelling because of the the sounds and noise will influence my thoughts, I actually waste my time while travel because of that. yes a good In-Ear earphone can help but this is another level. So now I can actually do my stuff in my own world using this Noise Cancellation Headphones!

Value?

Yes -- if you have 30K to throw away. And it will not hurt your life in any way.
No -- if you need to save money for next 12 Months to get this.

Sound Quality?

Base is there! If you are looking for that.
But the nice thing is Sony's EQ can Adapt! That means anyone can change the Sound Aspects according to there needs from the Application. Out of the box it is perfect for my taste!
If someone like less base you can change that through EQ.

No product is perfect so in this Model what to improve?
- Only once device can be connected at a time. (Minimum 2 devices is required now a days! [eg Laptop and SmartPhone])
- User replaceable ear cup cushions!
- Call Quality. This Headphones have an array of microphones but when when we call someone they will hear all Background Noise. I used it for some VOIP calls, It is usable but built in Microphones on your phone will do a much better job.
- More and improved NC! Yes why not. There is always room for improvements.
^^ I really don't know what to write as cons.
I will Update this after using this for a week or two. bye.",['Expensive but the way to go! my FIRST Noise Cancellation Headphones!']
19760,5,Just received my 1000MX3 . Just as you would expect from Amazon. Everything was perfect. Burned just four songs from my Apple Music playlist. That was all that was needed to make my decision. I have been using my QC 35 since the last year or so and used to use it a lot for streaming . I and my wife have a completely opposite tastes in TV Viewership therefore one of us uses the headphones. Noise cancelling is hands down better than QC 35 and sound quality is also better if just slightly so . The feature of allowing outside sound while keeping a hand on one of the cups is also very good. This is my very first impression. Maybe I’ll follow up with a more detailed review after using it more . For now I’ll say that if you’re confused between QC 35 and 1000Mx3 I’ll say go for the Sony,['Bose QC35 beater']

19763,1,"I have to mention the satisfaction rate for this headphone dropped from absolutely satisfied to absolutely disappointed. Because to begin with I was quite happy with the spot-on features and enigmatic sound quality. However, quite quickly situation changed for the worse and within two months of usage, I’ve started to experience reduced volume on the right side headphone and noise cancellation has gone for a toss and is behaving as if it has a mind of its own, it is producing blurring noises on it’s own, perhaps in an attempt to cancel ambient noise. On the sound quality front, I wish to mention I am a purist and user of Apple Music, therefore I can safely say when there is some deterioration in the level of sound quality, more often than not, I am able to notice it. These headphones which are positioned by Sony as a market leader for their brand in this product category, has sadly started to produced a crackling sound on moderately high volume, more of a distortion, especially on songs with deep bass frequencies. This is something one may most probably notice on cheaper headphones which can’t handle a full-band of frequencies at play I believe. To conclude, I am highly regretting my decision of choosing this over the Bose QCIII, I wish I bought that.",['Highly disappointed.']

19765,5,"I pre ordered this from Amazon on the 12th of October and received the product on 22nd after launch on 18th. Others from normal orders received it before me. Don't ever trust Amazon with pre-orders, no one there knows what pre order ACTUALLY MEANS.

On 24TH OCT (2 days later) I noticed a weird noise kinda faint static on the right ear cup when the ANC turned ON. Returned the defective one and got the replacement on 26th October. A lot of others have reported this issue. This is defect is on few devices. Think of it as a minor annoyance. But even with the defect I was excited each time I used it.

Keep in mind that this noise is so faint that you have turn off music to be able to notice. For me it was on the right ear cup, but people have reported this noise from either of ear cups.

Apart from XM3, I have both Sony XM2, BOSE QC 35 II. Xm3 hands down the best in NC Performance. The sound quality is great, it's bass heavy (compared to the 2 above) so I like to listen to XM3 more than bose, which sounds flat and doesn't get you immersed. For context: I listen to heavy metal and rock music. The customizer in the app is awesome. Sony just sounds better than bose, maybe partly also because of hi-res audio, more HD Codec support like LDAC, SBC ETC.

Mic and phone call performance on M3s is on par with bose. Bose is better. But XM2s were worst. I take calls from noisy environments like co work space, open parking are zone with wind gushing, in cabs in bus, etc others never complained one single time about my voice being inaudible.

When you open the device it comes with 100 percentage battery charged. Sony is great, come XM2 AND BOSE, comes with 70 percent. One weird this is if app is not connect and registered it the devise says low battery even though it's fully charged.

So I typically use bose when I work at office as daily driver (as it also has multi device connectivity).

M3s have come a long way on comfort, and now the only con with xm3 is that my ear sweats a lot, this doesn't happen with Bose quietcomfort. I like the love the gesture controls on M3 more than button on bose. I wish there was way to lock down touch to limit unintended touch triggers.

Wrt to battery life is AWESOME. One really can't ask for more. There is no standby battery discharge, my observation over 5 days of no activity. The auto off does not work because any one device is always connected.

On the build quality, I like bose better. Honestly, this is the only area I like bose better.

Closing thoughts, Bose is my daily driver because it allows me to connect with Mac and phone same time. I can swap and connect calls easily. Also the sound signature isn't immersive, allows me to work even when the music is on. XM3s for me are the special ones, I use them for the special 'me' time. When I am looking to just enjoy music.

PS. I am a developer / maker of Story Stream a platform to publish and stream immersive audio stories narrated by RJs and Voice artists. Story stream is live on Alex and coming soon on Google assistant devices. I use these headpphones for testing my apps ;) (if you have Alexa, you can enable Story Stream from the store)

And that's the only reason why I have 3 expensive headphones. If I had to pick one, it's will be XM3 in a heart beat, even though it a good 15days old now, I get excited everytime I pick it up from the case to wear! Even though the bose is newer, I don't get as excited.

If you have the budget, go for it. I can guarantee that you will be very excited about using it each time you put it on. This comes from some one who got a defective product, I swear even with the defective piece I was so excited about using it each time till the replacement arrived. Honestly Sony has done a tremendous job on XM3.",['My honest review of XM3s and parallel with bose']

I read a lot of praise about this product online and decided to go for it. I really tried to like it, but the ANC caused a weird pressure drop inside the earcups. It felt like my eardrums were being sucked out.

I feel that the level of comfort one would have with ANC would depend on the strength of their inner ears. It is a great product & ANC works like a charm, but do bear in mind that many users on Reddit have reported feeling nauseous and having ear discomfort on using ANC.

Detailed review: I purchased this item on 28 August. As headphone had 92% charge I did not bother to charge it. Six days after the purchase I decided to charge as battery was low, and this is when I noticed charging port of the headphone has serious flaw as charging cable was not properly attaching to the charging port so charging headphone was completely impossible. I thought item I received may be faulty one so I immediately notified this to amazon and amazon agreed for replacement as it was the last day of replacement window. Today I received replacement item. To my surprise (nightmare)this time seller sent me used product. You can see in the photograph there is no lamination plastic on the box and box is manually closed with plastic sticking, even seller had tried to hide previous purchase label by sticking another blank label over it. I opened the box and again checked for charging port and realised there is serious flaw in the charging port design. Due to faulty design charging wire can not hold on charging port of headphone so charging is not possible. I immediately notified this matter including sellers fraud to amazon. Amazon accepted this problem and agreed for refund. My experience with this product was bad but I must say I liked Amazon's customer oriented approach and immediate issue of refund.",['Serious flaw in the design']

2. Sound quality is horrible and there were drops in sound. I think this could because Bluetooth hardware in the earphones is not good.

19833,4,"I was looking for printer for printers 10 prints a day ...so i discussed with friends. All my friends said buy anyone Epson or HP all good but buy INTANK. Hence i read everything. For my case EPSON, BROTHER were coming to best. Hence my friend was using EPSON from 4 years ..so i blindly bought it.
1. Printer speed is good
2. Resolution for print is good
3. Cost effective
4. Works wireless via phone, win, mac laptops.
5. Easy to use & install

I think you can blindly buy it. Warranty is 30K pages or 1 year whatever comes first.
Any queries let me know.
All intank printers are good but depends on use case.
If you use case is Printing pics etc more ..go for Canon or HP. Else
If color printing is not only thing ...rest all parameters EPSON/ brother are good.

Scanning part could be made a little bit fast, even for lowest quality scanning, it's takes around 1 min

Otherwise for Xerox, and printing B/w this is THE best in the competition

19835,5,"I got this to print few pages since we are all working from home now. Set up was super easy, just download the software from Epson website (they give a CD but who has a CD drive anymore?). Really have nothing to complain about.
Pros -
1. Connecting to WIFI was easy and the printer has stayed connected for over a week. No drop in signal.
2. Wake up from sleep mode and to print was really quick, was able to print the first page in less than 5 sec from the time it woke up and started printing.
3. Scanner is working good, no issue there.
4. Refil was easy, the ink comes in a no-spill type bottle and there is no way you can mess the refill.
5. Unlike HP and other printers which use a cartridge, this one uses ink tank. Hence you dont have to fill it up fully if you print very little and not worry about ink drying up.
6. App is good. You can basically do anything from the app that you can do via computer.

Cons -
These are not really issue as they are what defines a low end ink tank printer, but something that can be a deal breaker for few.
1. No ADF, it can hold some 10 paper at a time. We need to keep adding paper
2. Scans via the glass, so cant scan many pages at one go.
3. Original Epson inks are not always available on Amazon. HP seems to have their products much more often and always in qtd.",['A perfect print for home/low printing needs']

19837,5,"Bought printer during lockdown to print school related things. Did a lot of research to decide between ink tank and ink jet. That plus advise and feedback culminated in the purchase of the 3152. And it’s awesome!

The set up was very easy. Of course I didn’t read the instructions carefully so it took me a bit more time but that’s my fault. Set up was fast otherwise. I have set up the WiFi printing - in fact we only use that. Everyone in the house including the wife and kids have learnt how to print without an issue. Initially it looked like the blank ink was finishing really fast but doesn’t look like it.
Keep in mind initial head allignment will use up ink bit thereafter it’s great.

Not as great as a laser obviously. And I think ink jet quality is better. But for school etc this works very well. Ink jet would not last these many prints for sure.

Have been using for around 40 odd days. The usage has been heavy due to school so not sure how it survives low usage.

19851,5,"This is an efficient and reliable single function monochrome printer! I was looking for a good laser duplex printer. After a lot of search, I found this printer to be the most appropriate. In fact, I wanted to get a colour laser printer but found them to be very expensive and unnecessary as colour prints are rarely needed. The toner costs are astronomical! If a single original black toner cartridge costs half the cost of this printer, imagine the cost of coloured toners! Besides the initial cost of a laser colour printer is outrageously high. So unless you really need one, don’t waste your time looking for one. Inkjet colour printers are cheaper so you can opt for them. But be advised that they aren’t easy to maintain. Unlike inkjet printers, ink leaks won't occur even if the laser printer isn’t used for a long time.

Setting up this printer was very easy and I had it running in minutes. Duplex printing is fantastic. It saves paper, time and energy. The paper tray stacks 250 papers neatly within the printer. Always use dual print compatible papers to avoid causing paper jams or poor quality prints. The toner (TN-2365) that comes with the printer has a stated capacity of 2,600 pages. But eventually the number will be close to 1,500 pages. If you use the toner saver mode then it may reach 2,000 pages. Additionally, the drum (DR-2365) which houses the toner will also have to be replaced after every 12,000 prints. The print speed is impressive. It can print 30 (A4) or 32 (Legal) pages in a minute. I have printed 750 pages at once all under 30 minutes. I haven’t had a single paper jam or any other issue while doing it and in all the 6 months use. This implies reliability.

Compatible refills and cartridges are easily available for this model and costs a fraction of what an original toner cartridge (costs Rs. 3,000) would! Compatibles will affect the print quality to an extent and depending on their quality and how the cartridge is refilled, it may cause leaks within the printer. Therefore care should be taken regarding this. Do note that compatibles will void the printer’s warranty. So it would be better to go for compatibles after the warranty period. Being compact, it occupies less space. It comes in a two tone appearance (Black and Grey) and doesn't have wireless printing. The similar all black colour  Brother Laser Printer HL-L2366DW  is actually a different model with wireless printing. So don’t expect this model to come in an all black colour.

Check whether the printer has any defects upon delivery. If defective, get it replaced within the 10 days replacement period to avoid complications. As for the printer's maintenance, it is very important to locate the printer in an open area or room to prevent overheating. Make sure that the printer’s sides have enough gap to allow cooling. Finally ensure that the printer is covered when it isn’t in use to protect it from dust. These simple things will give the printer longevity. Brother has produced a very good duplex printer that is affordable and reliable and I can assure you that this printer is a perfect fit for a small office or for your home. If you are looking for an affordable duplex printer, this printer is a fantastic buy and a no brainer!

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
======================
A lot of home users want a Multi-Function printer. Though they are useful and save space, they have many cons. They are expensive and come with inferior quality scanners and copiers (High Quality and Durable MF Printers are even more expensive!). Besides these scanners break down easily. If the printer function is working fine despite a disfunctional scanner, repairing the scanner can cause complications to it. To be brief, it’s hard to repair either the printer or scanner in a MF Printer! If you really need a scanner, go for a stand alone scanner. Opting for a single function printer will be cheaper and easier to maintain and repair. Additionally compared to a MF Printer, you will get better stand alone products for a lesser price!

4 YEARS UPDATE AS OF 01/10/2021
=============================
Some reviews mention that this printer's printing cost is high. That is incorrect and untrue! I used cheaper but good quality cartridges costing around Rs. 800 which have reduced the cost per print. These reviewers have casually reviewed this printer, hence they incorrectly state the high printing cost of this printer!

When low toner warning sets in. Check online for steps how to get rid of that annoying warning. Once done you will get prints normally closer to stated yield of the cartridge! Many people simply replace the old cartridge. As a result they lose a significant number of pages that the old cartridge can print! Beware of this.

It has been 4 years since I bought this printer. I am happy to tell you that it works very well to date. During this period, I bought the  Apple leaders Printer Dust Cover for Brother HL-L2321D - Blue  in order to protect the printer from dust. Throughout this time, this printer has proven to be durable and reliable and so I can once again reiterate that this is a reliable and an affordable duplex printer!",['THE RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE PRINTER - UPDATED 01/10/2021 - 4 YEARS REVIEW!']

I must tell that I was and to some extent sceptical and scared that how will such a low cost printer handle duplex printing over the years.. Let's see..

Initial thoughts :

1. Installation was a breeze.. All the things were guided nicely by the guide papers, paper cut-out indicators etc.
2. Print quality is awesome.. Printed around 500 pages as soon as I got hands over it..
3. Single side print speed is around 30 ppm as advertised.. It litterally throws paper like bullets, such excellent sppeds..
4. Double side print speed is on a little lower side at around 8 sec per print i.e around 7.5 ppm..
5. All error handling lights and LEDs are very user friendly as well as status monitor (for Windows) is nice and concise way of seeing what printer is doing now..
6. Build quality is as per the best printers in market.. no cheap material whatsoever at any part of the body.. (By looks, it looks like a 17k - 20k printer..

No issue aroused so far.
You can refill its cartridge by yourself or get it refilled in market which will cost around ₹300-400 which is 8 times cheaper than the new brother cartridge and print quality is almost same.
It is a duplex printer i.e. prints simultaneously on both sides of paper. The print speed is highly satisfying.
I have printed 550 pages at one go without any page stuck.
The no. Of pages that can be printed in 1 cartridge depends on what you print i.e. printing text only will allow you to print around 1500-1600 pages (this is just an approx. idea as i have not counted the no. Of pages printed)
if you print pages with images you will end up your cartridge with less no. of printed pages.
It also depends on whether you turned on toner saver mode or not.
Also dont forget to turn on duplex mode before printing.
I will update this review after some time when my cartridge will be finished and will let to know the no. Of pages it prints in 1 full cartridge.

Everyday I am spending so much time to resolve one or the other issue. Now I feel the only thing HP wants is all my personal details during set up, no help after that. It has given me problems only from the first day. It took so much time to install. Once installed, when I started taking print, the paper will reach halfway to the cartridge and then will show stuck. Everytime I have to turn off the printer and restart it to print the page. I need to repeat it after every sheet.

After that, when I was taking a print urgently, the margins of the printer never come properly as shown in the softcopy of the PDF. I took so many prints after changing the paper option to A4, letter and legal. Same results. Only after I changed the position of the paper and put it to one side of the tray, did the print come properly. First time I am encountering a printer, for which you can put paper in different positions in the tray for the print to come properly. Usually you put the paper in the up or down tray and the print comes properly. Now I am using another wifi, not the previous one. You can scan by connecting the USB cable, but it never prints. I checked multiple sites including HP help to change my wifi. I tried multiple suggestions given, but none works out. Also, I purchased a new black cartridge from Amazon online and connected it properly, but the cartridge status shows a red light. Dont know why.

Perfect printer for home and small office use. I do not require my printers to be WiFi enabled as they are shared over a network anyway so it is perfect for my requirements. Your mileage may vary.,"[""Very good printer (if you don't need wireless capabilities)""]"
19878,3,"A little about this printer:
1) Build quality: 3/5 - flimsy and prone to paper jams if paper is not inserted carefully.
2) Scan quality: 4/5 - really impressed with this one.
3) Print quality: 3/5 - OK for casual use. Not great, not bad either.
4) Software and drivers: 3/5 - installs a lot of unnecessary plugins, which cannot be unselected during installation. You have to manually remove each one after installation (e.g FTP plugin, Dropbox plugin, etc.)
5) Cartridges: 1/5 - no surprises here... 6 prints in, and the provided cartridges' ink levels have already dropped to 75%.
6) Additional points - unlike Canon, HP has its own Android app to print from a mobile phone via USB OTG cable, so that's a plus.

Since I only use a printer/scanner for emergencies (2-3 prints a month), I always go for the cheapest option, which in this case was this one for Rs. 3099/-. The only difference between HP DeskJet 2331 and 2332 is the colour (the former is violet-white and this one is grey-white) so grab whichever is cheaper. Inkjet printers are a scam in general - the printers are cheap but the cartridges are crazy expensive and the ink runs out before you can say the word 'PRINT'. If you're the type who prints a lot, better go for a laser printer. They are more cost efficient in the long run.",['You get what you pay for']

Firstly this product will not work with latest mac version, at least I could not get it to work after spend 3 hours trying everything possible in hp site and other internet suggestions.

Now amazon will say the the OS mentioned in the product is windows 10.7 so any other OS is your problem. There are answers here telling this product works with mac and even in HP site it is mentioned this series does not need a driver for mac (mac is preinstalled with the drivers) and can print/scan. But I doubt it works with the latest mac OS, maybe it works with older versions.

My suggestion is avoid this unless you use windows 10.7 as you will not get any help from Amazon or HP.

19909,1,"--- Update 11th Aug 2021 ---

Printer stopped working after about a year. It stopped accepting paper. I've cleaned the feed roller behind the tray and the transfer roller accessible from behind, yet to no resolve.

The canon onsite technician visited home to take a look. Tells me the problem is with the paper pickup assembly and not with the feed roller. Charged Rs. 650 in service fees without spending even 10 mins to check the printer. He said I should bring the printer to their service center but assembly related issues can rarely be fixed. Instead they may try to give me a replacement printer for a discount.

The printer has no dust deposits outside or inside and has been used about 20 times so far for help with a 10 yo kids homework assignments and some photo prints. I only used original ink cartridges which were replaced once so far.

I am writing this to help you decide whether owning a printer vs getting your prints from a print store nearby is a better option for you. I feel like unless you want to frequently (more than four time a week) need to take printouts without which your work cannot proceed, you should avoid owning a printer.

--- Original review ---

I am a veteran IT worker, have used numerous MFPs at work over the years. I always admired features such as duplex printing, ADF and scan to email in those huge expensive network printing machines.

Now you can enjoy most of those features (and more) in home printers such as this one. The printer was fairly easy to setup, and I started printing over WiFi using my laptop AND my OnePlus phone, in no time at all. I also use the printer to help my nephew with his homework assignments and so far everything has been working great.

I even took some prints for photo frames etc on glossy photo papers and those too turned out fabulous!

The printer is well worth the money and the ink cartridges can last adequately if you take the time to learn how to use it properly.

Quick tip 1 - The better the quality of printer media the better the print turns out. So make sure you use good quality paper when you expect the best quality print; whether for photos or regular document prints.

Quick tip 2 - Make sure you know how to use photo editing software to get the exact size of print outs you really want. If you use A4 sized paper and mistakenly print a 4x6 with borderless printing, you will end up wasting a lot of ink, for a picture you may not use after all.",['A good printer while it lasts']

1. Colour image print takes a lot of time. In some cases, it takes upto 3 minutes to print a page. This is mostly dependent upon the file size of the photo. Bigger the size, higher the time. At certain times the print quality may not be that impressive as you may expect.

2. For setting up the printer, company has not given a user manual. This may get a little difficult for people who are not highly tech friendly, as bringing up the printer on your local LAN maybe some trouble. A printer on LAN helps you print pages with a lot of convenience.

19934,5,"Chose canon over others due to its mega reputation and Classy size & shape.Its all-in-one ability supersedes all contemporary brands.

Here are my few observations of the product :

1.) Its an ink tank printer that comes with separate ink tanks to be filled with ink red , yellow , blue & black .Its always considered to be more economical for per page printing and should be chosen if you have bulk work on a routine basis.

In these ink tank printers, it is also required to take prints on a minimum weekly basis or prolonged non-usage may lead to drying of heads .

2.) The construction of the printer is very elegant and solid and the ink tanks are absorbed in the regular chassis of the printer unlike HP brand, however it is my personal preference.

Solid doesn't mean you can afford to drop it , it means the plastic used for construction feels very premium and rigid.

3.) Regarding functionality - It can scan and print documents very fast .Page size supported is from 4.0""x 6.0"" photo paper to A4 ,Letter ,Legal , A5 , B5 .

I purchased glossy kodak photo papers 280 GSM & paperone A4 100 GSM papers and the print quality was excellent.

For pictures , it takes few minutes but its worth the wait .If you choose the right paper the photos are bound to be very good ,However at few places i found the shade of green slightly dark in print than in actual photo that was scanned.

Resolution is good for both photos and documents.

Printing makes slight noise but is tolerable , its not like neighbour or even other room person will be disturbed.

4.) Got it with additional warranty for onsite repair for next 2 years.

5.) I bought it first then realized i don't have that much work to use it on daily basis so i would ask my readers to buy only if you have routine works or make use of shops.",['Canon surely brings life to colors. Excellent scanner too. Made the right choice.']
19935,5,"I am writing this review on this printer after using it for over a year. In this year, I printed about 2000+ pages both color and black&white. So my review is based on observations on them.

=== Print Quality ===
This is definitely the brightest point with this printer. I used Epson ink tank printer earlier and were not satisfied with the results of it. But this Canon printer makes the cut. I am amazed to see the results of the printing both color and B&W. I printed many photos on photo papers and the results were better than the inkjet printers.

=== Ink Longevity ===
This is another biggest selling point of this printer. The printer came with 4 ink bottles - Black, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow. After printing over 2000 pages so far (photos and documents) I still see 50% of the ink left.

=== Ease of Use ===
I can connect this to my wifi router and get started in 5 minutes. All I need is to read the instructions carefully. And voila, all my devices - Computer, Laptop, Mobile and iPad - can print without any hassles. They can detect the printer and starts printing just in minute.

=== Paper Feeding ===
In my more than one year experience with this printer, I never faced a single paper jam. If at all something happens, check paper feeder if any small objects stuck accidentally.

=== Scanner ===
Not used much but overall quality was ok. If you want crystal clear scans, this is not for you.

=== Copier ===
Its just a click of button. Keep your document inside the scanner and click on blabk or color button. Your document copy is ready.

=== Issues ===
So far I came across only one issue. The printer orange light starts blinking and the messages shows that the ink cleaner bed was overflown and needs a service. But I followed the instructions on Youtube videos, cleaned the ink cleaning bed and cartridges for 4 to 5 times and then the printer came back to normal. But this took over 4 hours to understand and solve the issue.

=== Advice ===
1. Do not perform system cleaning too many times. This will cause overflowing of tank on ink cleaner bed and malfunction your primter.
2. Do not use cheap paper, use paper such as JK Sparkle etc.
3. Do not print photo prints on normal paper, use photo paper or thick paper.
4. Make sure to print few papers at least once a week with all colors. This will reduce color logging inside the tubes.

Overall, I am very satisfied with this printer and the quality of prints it gives you.

Update 11/11/19
I faced one more issue after long time. The printer unable to feed the paper and I couldn't find any object inside the feed. After two days of struggling I came up with an idea of reverse feeding the paper from inside the printer, i.e. open the top box to see printer inside and switch off and onthe printer.

19941,1,"I purchased this model not knowing it's a VA Panel. But then convinced me to use it. As soon as it's powered, I felt very bad buying this monitor. Firstly it was defective, there was an annoying green pattern on the display. In addition to that, Thunderbolt(USB C) did not work with MAC. After having a bad experience, called support to return the product. The support personnel wasn't patient enough, not even sympathetic. outright informed me to keep using the defective monitor. After a long escalation and multiple calls, finally, they accepted for replacement instead of return. Once again decided to give it a try. Received a second one, this time packaging and the box were in bad shape. Then anyway started to use the monitor. After an hour or two started noticing a green tint on the screen and the display going blank every 10 - 30 mins. It will remain there for over a second or two. It was really annoying as well. Then called the support and this time the support personal accepted the defect by seeing the picture and the return was completed.

Many people have complained about the panel being a VA and not an IPS. While I admit it's annoying that the luminance gets shifted a bit if viewing from odd angles, this is meant to be used as a monitor and not a TV. Therefore, despite its technological disadvantage I'm happy to sit in front of it and experience rather good picture quality.

Pros:
* This one monitor replaced my : 1) Laptop charger 2) USB-C dongle and hub 3) HDMI cables 4) multi-pin spike buster into a truly single cable solution. One plug to the wall, one cable to the laptop and everything works.
* Display is huge, no stuck pixels, color reproduction is almost as good as a macbook pro
* Integrated USB hub, plugged my keyboard/mouse there
* Height adjust stand is pretty nice IMO

Cons:
* There's some minor ghosting of white moving text on black backgrounds but its fine for casual gaming or movie watching
* Large monitor surface and therefore some amount of glare can be visible on screen, have to turn up brightness during sunny days

19948,3,"The LG 32UL750 features a thin chassis and the Edge-Arcline stand. However, unlike the LG’s IPS offerings, this VA panel still includes bezels which make it less attractive.

Pros:
✓ HDR 600 ✓ USB-C ✓ 4k resolution ✓ 32-inch ✓ 3000:1 contrast ratio ✓ Affordable ✓ Accurate and vibrant colors ✓ Low input lag and quick response time
Cons:
✘ VA panel ✘ Polarizing aesthetics

It's a VA panel, which is middle and most balanced among the three (TN, VA, IPS). Although this panel may not have the same level of color accuracy as an IPS panel, it does have its own advantages, such as increased contrast. The total contrast on this panel is 3000:1, which is far higher than the 1000:1 average for IPS panels.

The overall brightness to 400 cd/m2 nits, is a high-end figure and a superb total for a VA panel.

Controls are very intuitive, however because this is a pre-calibrated monitor, it does not want you to adjust colors.

Macbook pro or M1 Mac mini connected via Type-C works flawless.

The colors are great when you look straight onto the monitor. However, when you look at certain angle, the colors will gray out!

One downside to the design is the lack of cable management. They can’t be fed into the stand or hidden in any other way, so you’ll just have to live with them hanging down from their ports.

The monitor has a pair of 5W speakers, and the sound really isn’t the strong point here. It’s acceptable for general computer notifications only. Not for music/movies.

The LG 32UL750-W is one of the most affordable high-end professional monitor you can buy currently. Its features combined make it an excellent alternative for media professionals.

Following are my observations:
1) The first thing I noticed is that top and side bezels of the monitor are very thin which is aesthetically pleasing and gives it a premium look.
2) Screen is decent and has good brightness and contrast. Not sure about color reproduction but it feels alright.
3) Screen has a refresh rate of 60 Hz at 1920x1080 resolution. However it has an option of 75 Hz at 1024x768 resolution also.
4) Even though this monitor has Eye Care (Bright Intelligence), I felt that the sensor adjusted brightness is on higher side for my liking.
5) There is slight backlight bleed at top left corner of monitor which is noticeable only in very dark environments but overall has uniform IPS Glow.
6) Response time mentioned on the box is 5ms (Gray to Gray) and I felt it to be good for FPS games. Overall, it's a good monitor for casual gaming.
7) It comes with UK style power cord and needs a converter/adapter or a spike guard will work.
8) The box also includes HDMI cable and the monitor has cable management as shown in product description which I felt is a nice addition to the package.

Monitor has following ports:
D-Sub
HDMI Port
Display Port
Line-in port and
3.5 mm jack for plugging in earphones

This monitor also has in-built speakers which are pointed downwards. The quality of audio from them is nothing to brag about and max volume is that of a typical tablet (my iPad Pro 12.9"" 2017 has better sound output than them) but no complaints here considering the price of the monitor.

19951,5,"I have worked on many monitors (Dell, HP, Acer) in office and home. Never had a Benq. I will get this out of the way, my favourite brand is Dell (I have bought around 10 products). I was torn between the Dell (2717H), Viewsonic and Acer. For some reason I never had a good experience with products of HP.

My requirement was a 27"" monitor. I am not a serious gamer only play casual games from time to time. The main purpose was to do programming and watching videos (and reading). This monitor suits perfectly.
Pros:
- Excellent display. It had a bit of light bleed on top right corner but it was just the glass a bit out. I just pressed it in and the bleed was gone.
- Good contrast and viewing angles. I have not played any FPS games till now but overall the experience till now (10 days) has been smooth and consistent. The 5ms response time is good enough for me.
- Although it is a 1080p display, the text and videos appear sharp, no pixelation or ghosting. Colours are uniform and even.
- Bluelight filtering is good. Helps when reading a long book / article and puts less strain in the eyes.
Cons:
- The Eyecare feature is a bit aggressive. The display becomes too bright for the surrounding light. I just switched it to standard and set the brightness and contrast to levels I am comfortable with. The day/night light in my room doesn't differ much so I don't need to change the settings.

Other monitors with similar features were around or over 20k, I got this for 17k. Overall a very good budget monitor. It also has 3 years warranty which is good and tells that I can expect a pretty long life from this.

19954,5,"I was skeptical about this BenQ G480 eye care 24” inch monitor first. After a lot of research, I found this monitor too good for regular reading and office work. I previously had a DELL 21.5 inch monitor which that has a really thin bezel on the side and the top. Further, it is quite good in color production along with two fine speakers at the bottom.

Now, for the last 1 year, I had this severe pain in my eyes as I mostly work in front of the screen. The pain gradually increased at times I couldn’t even stare at the screen perhaps, due to the harmful blue light emission. I was waiting for the shopping days to come up where I can buy a decent monitor(bigger size) and also that could help me get rid of severe eye strain.

As I already use blue cut lenses I did not find the previous monitor abstain harmful blue light. And this time I have decided to buy the BenQ monitor 24 inches (Eye Care). I did not expect to be excellent in color production either I play games using this.
After, I received the monitor which I purchased just for 7.8k during the festive season deal.

I found the feature “Low blue light” and “Brightness intelligence technology” - uses a dedicated sensor to map out the ambient lighting to adjust the temperature and brightness of the screen which seriously I have never seen on budget monitors.
Anyways, I am quite happy with the purchase I have tested and experienced no flicker issue neither extreme blue light emission after you have just switched to “Low blue light emission”.

In addition, I received a major upgrade to 24 inches that allow me for seamless reading. Moreover, the monitor comes with 36 months of on-site warranty but sadly, you can register the monitor on their website there is no option to do that.
I have seen people complaining about the screen bleeding issue. Fortunately, I did not face anything yet.

I am in love with my new 24 inches BenQ monitor irrespective of having 5 ms response and limited to 60Hz refresh rate. This monitor is perfect for and reading, working for a longer duration but can’t say about photo or video editing work. I purchased the monitor mainly seeing the eye care technology that puts less strain on eyes even after continuous usage of 6 hours.

19958,5,"I bought this in late December 2019 for 12.9K. I had switched to this from a 22 inch LG monitor (model 22MP68VQ, to be precise). The color reproduction on that monitor was downright brilliant. So, when I plugged this one in out of the box, to be honest, I was somewhat disappointed. The colours looked so faded and unappealing, the blacks were nowhere near black and the overall panel appeared to be so low quality, that I almost contemplated returning it.

However, when I tinkered with its settings, boy was I amazed. The color reproduction improved massively, including the contrast and brightness. I also made some changes to the Intel display driver's setting (mine is a Windows system), however, that might be different for you based on your system.

First and foremost, go to ""Picture Advanced"" menu on the OSD (on-screen display), and set Picture Mode to ""User"". This will turn off all settings such as Bright Intelligence, Low Blue Light, etc. (Trust me, you don't want to keep them enabled for the best picture quality). Then navigate to ""Picture"" tab in the main menu. Here are the monitor's settings that worked really well for me:

1. Brightness: 100 (you may lower it if it hurts your eyes)
2. Contrast: 60
3. Sharpness: 5
4. Gamma: 5
5. Color Temperature: Normal
6: Hue: 50
7. Saturation: 50

Once you have tweaked settings to the above numbers, you will see it greatly improves the picture quality. However, if you have an Intel display driver like I do, you can tweak the settings there too for an even better picture. Here are the steps for that:

1. Search ""Intel Graphics Command Center"" in start (this may be different for you if you're running an older driver). If you can't find it in start, you should be able to right-click on your desktop and go to Intel Display Settings too.
2. Navigate to the ""Display"" tab.
3. Go to ""Color"" tab in the window.
4. Leave ""Brightness Enhancement"" to default at 50.
5. Change ""Contrast Enhancement"" to 48 from 50.
6. Enable ""Luminance-based Color Model"". (THIS IS A MAJOR GAME CHANGER)

And voila! Your these settings would breathe a new life into an otherwise dull default settings.

One thing to note here is that the piece that I received had slight IPS glow / backlight bleed from upper left corner, mostly noticeable in very dark environments with 100% brightness (see attached picture). However, it is very common in IPS displays, and gets worse as the screen size increases. I didn't want to gamble with a replacement product, so I chose to stick with this one. Mine came with zero dead pixels, so I was worried about the replacement being worse (more backlight bleed / presence of dead pixels).",['Great value for money; do make sure to adjust settings']

19961,3,"This monitor isn't really for everyone. It's a good monitor, I really liked some aspects of it, but the cons of this monitor overwhelm the pros of the monitor, not by much though. If you can live through the cons, this monitor just might be for you. Gonna start with the cons:
1. Backlight Bleeding - If you don't know what this means, the LCD(liquid crystal display), the screen, is Backlit by CCFL/LED's, the LCD blocks out the backlight that is not needed when displaying a particular image. When this light is not 100% blocked, allowing excess light to ""bleed"" around the edges of the LCD panel.
This issue makes the background light up at some spots at the edges on a dark/black background. This is really annoying. It did bother me. This type of issue happens when the monitors are not 'factory calibrated'.
2. Viewing Angles - Monitor is advertised for 178degrees, which is not entirely true. You can see as wide as 178degrees. But colours especially blacks and whites turn into greyish black and yellowish white, image(desktop wallpaper) quality really gets worse after about 40 degrees from centre, also the light spots due to backlight bleed really starts to show up at when you watch screen from the angle, However shockingly when watching movies, the viewing angles are much better, still can't be compared with an IPS panel viewing angles, which are way better than these. (This monitor has a VA panel)

Now for the pros, and why should you get it?
1. Deep Blacks - Oh my god, I loved the blacks of this screen, but only when viewing from the centre. This monitor has deep rich blacks than any IPS panel screen I have worked on. Blacks tend to get screwed up when viewing from the angle due to backlight bleed.
2. Curved screen - At this price point, this is the only curved screen in the market. Curved screen doesn't really matter for 24"" 16:9 monitor. It's not wide enough to really feel that immersive experience. Although aesthetically it does look pleasing, your family members or friends will get intrigued by seeing a curved screen. As a user, it didn't really matter to me. This one is subjective user to user.

My verdict, if you can live through backlight bleeding and weird colour reproducing when viewing through angles. This monitor produces really deep contrast images with vivid colours when viewing from the centre and it just might for you.

Professionals - I won't recommend for professionals or for office use. However, It will work for professional use if you work alone and doesn't really care about viewing angles. Still better if you go with an IPS panel monitor.

Hardcore gamers - I won't recommend for hardcore gaming too, No gaming monitor is made of VA panel. Do you wanna win a game or have a better contrast?

Casuals - Recommended for this category, this category is for people who wanna use for browsing, do some gaming but are not a hardcore gamer. Someone who watches a lot of movies. This might be the right one for you and a steal deal for the price you are getting compared to the rest of the market.

19965,5,"I have two of these monitors. The first one was bought in late 2017 and I bought another one now. I work with a lot of Word, Text and PDF documents and it is easier if I can keep multiple screens open. All these days I was using the laptop screen + the external monitor as a dual screen set-up. But the laptop screen is quite small (13"" Toshiba Z30C), so I decided to invest in a second monitor. This review is for regular users (not gamers.)
[1] The main feature I love is the 'eye saver mode'. Considering that I use the monitors for 10 ~ 12 hours every day, I can feel the difference. When I use it in normal mode, I get eye strain. The reddish eye saver mode is quite effective.
[2] When connected with HDMI, the audio signal is also optionally output through the Headphone jack behind the monitor. Since I use my laptop as a CPU and prefer to keep it on a shelf, I can use wired headphones easily through the monitor port - quite useful.
[3] I run dual extended monitors - one connected via HDMI & one with VGA - both run at full HD (1920 x 1080) mode. The VGA connection will be a little fuzzy around the font edges, but given that VGA is analog signal, this is natural. Both are perfectly usable and if they were separate, I wouldn't even notice the fuzziness. But when they are right next to each other, I can make out the difference.
[4] The curvature of the monitor does not adversely affect image editing; it works perfectly fine. Straight-lines are still straight lines in any image editing software.
[5] Since VGA is becoming quite obsolete, some of the newer monitors have started dropping the VGA port. But it is quite useful, especially if your machine already has dual ports.

Only grouse : Compared to the previous edition that I bought in late 2017 (Same Model), there has been a little bit of cost cutting. Last time the box had HDMI + VGA cables. This time, the box only had the VGA cable.

My verdict : It is a good monitor and worth buying if you have to work with multiple screens.",['I have two of these - dual monitor set-up.']
19966,3,"Okay let's start off the things you shouldn't get it to do in it: Video rendering, Photo editing, Graphic designing, Programming or any kind of editing related to texts and visuals.
The things this is good for: Gaming and watching movies and for your entertainment purposes.

Just look at the first image (*sharpness is on 60). The text looks pixelated (your eyes will catch more than my camera did) and it becomes hard to read the small texts. Obviously a 15'' 1080p display would look good but when you pack those pixels in a larger 24'' display, you're gonna get more jagged edges. The pictures look fine but if you're looking at the tiny ones (e.g. a youtube thumbnails), you'll notice how grainy they are.

It's hasn't even been 2 month and yet I got a dead (or stuck) pixel and the HDMI port stopped working. Now, I'm stuck with the VGA. I will claim the warranty and get it checked off! Edit: HDMI port wasn't faulty, the cable was. Also, using a premium quality cable drastically improves the picture quality and sharpness!

It does have tilt! People who are saying this can't be tilted, must look at the fourth picture. Just apply some force to the upwards and it will tilt!

But they must know before buying this is that it is a VA panel (clearly mentioned in title, isn't it?) and VA panels are all about the center & single-person things. So if you're buying one, then you must know that you are buying it for yourself and not for the person looking at your monitor from the side. But these panels tend to have good color productions (not as IPS though) but it doesn't seem to be with this monitor. With some tweaks I somehow managed some fixes for the yellowish tint and washed out colors:
(I have my brightness on 30)
- Set the sharpness to 60/63 and the contrast to 75. (If isn't already)
- Go to the Color and set the gamma to Mode3, Red to 43, Green to 45 and the Blue to 52. This will produce more vibrant colors and fix the yellowish tint.
- *Keep the Samsung Upscale turned off, it certainly drops the image quality and increases sharpness.
- Choose the response time as fastest (optional).
And adjust the tilt and make it more centered, so the bad viewing angles won't bother you.
If you're planning to buy it just to game and watch movies, you can go for it. 27'' model would be better, because you will less notice the curve from the middle in the smaller one. A 24 inch monitor with curve is straight up a gimmick!
But if it's not for your entertainment purposes, then I'd recommend you to go with the LG's 22'' IPS monitor (priced same as this one on Amazon). The larger screen and curve must not allure you, a large monitor will only look sharp and good if it's at least 1440p and having an IPS panel.","[""I'm not saying it's bad.. it's just not suitable for everything""]"

1. The curve of the screen is very much noticeable even from a distance which adds the most value for the product.
2. The control joystick is a great additional feature which makes changing settings a joy.
3. The screen is tiltable so that absence of height adjustment not greatly felt.

Following are my observations:
1) The first thing I noticed is that top and side bezels of the monitor are very thin which is aesthetically pleasing and gives it a premium look.
2) Screen is decent and has good brightness and contrast. Not sure about color reproduction but it feels alright.
3) Screen has a refresh rate of 60 Hz at 1920x1080 resolution. However it has an option of 75 Hz at 1024x768 resolution also.
4) Even though this monitor has Eye Care (Bright Intelligence), I felt that the sensor adjusted brightness is on higher side for my liking.
5) There is slight backlight bleed at top left corner of monitor which is noticeable only in very dark environments but overall has uniform IPS Glow.
6) Response time mentioned on the box is 5ms (Gray to Gray) and I felt it to be good for FPS games. Overall, it's a good monitor for casual gaming.
7) It comes with UK style power cord and needs a converter/adapter or a spike guard will work.
8) The box also includes HDMI cable and the monitor has cable management as shown in product description which I felt is a nice addition to the package.

Monitor has following ports:
D-Sub
HDMI Port
Display Port
Line-in port and
3.5 mm jack for plugging in earphones

This monitor also has in-built speakers which are pointed downwards. The quality of audio from them is nothing to brag about and max volume is that of a typical tablet (my iPad Pro 12.9"" 2017 has better sound output than them) but no complaints here considering the price of the monitor.

Overall this monitor is value for money product considering the price I got it for.

19971,5,"I have worked on many monitors (Dell, HP, Acer) in office and home. Never had a Benq. I will get this out of the way, my favourite brand is Dell (I have bought around 10 products). I was torn between the Dell (2717H), Viewsonic and Acer. For some reason I never had a good experience with products of HP.

My requirement was a 27"" monitor. I am not a serious gamer only play casual games from time to time. The main purpose was to do programming and watching videos (and reading). This monitor suits perfectly.
Pros:
- Excellent display. It had a bit of light bleed on top right corner but it was just the glass a bit out. I just pressed it in and the bleed was gone.
- Good contrast and viewing angles. I have not played any FPS games till now but overall the experience till now (10 days) has been smooth and consistent. The 5ms response time is good enough for me.
- Although it is a 1080p display, the text and videos appear sharp, no pixelation or ghosting. Colours are uniform and even.
- Bluelight filtering is good. Helps when reading a long book / article and puts less strain in the eyes.
Cons:
- The Eyecare feature is a bit aggressive. The display becomes too bright for the surrounding light. I just switched it to standard and set the brightness and contrast to levels I am comfortable with. The day/night light in my room doesn't differ much so I don't need to change the settings.

Other monitors with similar features were around or over 20k, I got this for 17k. Overall a very good budget monitor. It also has 3 years warranty which is good and tells that I can expect a pretty long life from this.

It seems that 22inch or lower size monitors are best for Full HD Resolution. 24inch monitor will have larger pixels which will make text blurry and affect eyes. If you just want a bigger monitor, spend more money and go for Ultra HD ones. Otherwise, you may regret it as I have. Looking forward to selling mine!","['Go for 22 Inch Unless You are buying for Gaming, Movies etc.']"
19974,5,"I was skeptical about this BenQ G480 eye care 24” inch monitor first. After a lot of research, I found this monitor too good for regular reading and office work. I previously had a DELL 21.5 inch monitor which that has a really thin bezel on the side and the top. Further, it is quite good in color production along with two fine speakers at the bottom.

Now, for the last 1 year, I had this severe pain in my eyes as I mostly work in front of the screen. The pain gradually increased at times I couldn’t even stare at the screen perhaps, due to the harmful blue light emission. I was waiting for the shopping days to come up where I can buy a decent monitor(bigger size) and also that could help me get rid of severe eye strain.

As I already use blue cut lenses I did not find the previous monitor abstain harmful blue light. And this time I have decided to buy the BenQ monitor 24 inches (Eye Care). I did not expect to be excellent in color production either I play games using this.
After, I received the monitor which I purchased just for 7.8k during the festive season deal.

I found the feature “Low blue light” and “Brightness intelligence technology” - uses a dedicated sensor to map out the ambient lighting to adjust the temperature and brightness of the screen which seriously I have never seen on budget monitors.
Anyways, I am quite happy with the purchase I have tested and experienced no flicker issue neither extreme blue light emission after you have just switched to “Low blue light emission”.

In addition, I received a major upgrade to 24 inches that allow me for seamless reading. Moreover, the monitor comes with 36 months of on-site warranty but sadly, you can register the monitor on their website there is no option to do that.
I have seen people complaining about the screen bleeding issue. Fortunately, I did not face anything yet.

I am in love with my new 24 inches BenQ monitor irrespective of having 5 ms response and limited to 60Hz refresh rate. This monitor is perfect for and reading, working for a longer duration but can’t say about photo or video editing work. I purchased the monitor mainly seeing the eye care technology that puts less strain on eyes even after continuous usage of 6 hours.

I have attached several photos of the monitor and how it looks exactly. Also, I have tried to show the features that you can access using the buttons beneath the screen.",['Brilliant Eyecare protection technology | Brightness Intelligence Sensor | A complete Steal deal']

19978,5,"I bought this in late December 2019 for 12.9K. I had switched to this from a 22 inch LG monitor (model 22MP68VQ, to be precise). The color reproduction on that monitor was downright brilliant. So, when I plugged this one in out of the box, to be honest, I was somewhat disappointed. The colours looked so faded and unappealing, the blacks were nowhere near black and the overall panel appeared to be so low quality, that I almost contemplated returning it.

However, when I tinkered with its settings, boy was I amazed. The color reproduction improved massively, including the contrast and brightness. I also made some changes to the Intel display driver's setting (mine is a Windows system), however, that might be different for you based on your system.

First and foremost, go to ""Picture Advanced"" menu on the OSD (on-screen display), and set Picture Mode to ""User"". This will turn off all settings such as Bright Intelligence, Low Blue Light, etc. (Trust me, you don't want to keep them enabled for the best picture quality). Then navigate to ""Picture"" tab in the main menu. Here are the monitor's settings that worked really well for me:

1. Brightness: 100 (you may lower it if it hurts your eyes)
2. Contrast: 60
3. Sharpness: 5
4. Gamma: 5
5. Color Temperature: Normal
6: Hue: 50
7. Saturation: 50

Once you have tweaked settings to the above numbers, you will see it greatly improves the picture quality. However, if you have an Intel display driver like I do, you can tweak the settings there too for an even better picture. Here are the steps for that:

1. Search ""Intel Graphics Command Center"" in start (this may be different for you if you're running an older driver). If you can't find it in start, you should be able to right-click on your desktop and go to Intel Display Settings too.
2. Navigate to the ""Display"" tab.
3. Go to ""Color"" tab in the window.
4. Leave ""Brightness Enhancement"" to default at 50.
5. Change ""Contrast Enhancement"" to 48 from 50.
6. Enable ""Luminance-based Color Model"". (THIS IS A MAJOR GAME CHANGER)

And voila! Your these settings would breathe a new life into an otherwise dull default settings.

One thing to note here is that the piece that I received had slight IPS glow / backlight bleed from upper left corner, mostly noticeable in very dark environments with 100% brightness (see attached picture). However, it is very common in IPS displays, and gets worse as the screen size increases. I didn't want to gamble with a replacement product, so I chose to stick with this one. Mine came with zero dead pixels, so I was worried about the replacement being worse (more backlight bleed / presence of dead pixels).",['Great value for money; do make sure to adjust settings']

I bought this monitor with very high expectations thinking am buying a gaming monitor. But alas even the text reading at times is difficult. This is a huge monitor, suits that purpose but we won't be able to use it much even for office purpose.

I have uploaded a video recorded through my samsung S10 mobile. Where I am comparing this monitor with laptop display.

1. Both are on 1080p resolution. And it's a 4k lion wallpaper. I understand laptop screen is relatively smaller, hence pixel density is on higher side. But still the 4k wallpaper should not look so Dull on AOpen monitor. I am using 1080p almost similar size display (Dell monitor) in my office. And colour reproduction is far better than what AOpen is able to display.

2. Even if we just focus on Taskbar on extreme right. We could see the colour difference. It's not an image, so no pixelation factor here. It's just a color fill.

So I am quite disappointed with this product. And once we buy it, there is no option to return it. Only thing we can do is ask for a replacement, which of course is of no use.

1. The monitor stopped working after 3 weeks. When raised complaint with amazon they refuse to refund. and when raised complaint with Lenovo they took the complaint but provided NO solution even after 1 month of chasing around. The customer care simply said that the part is not available. Hence, they can't provide refund or monitor replacement.

2. The monitor is not bezel-less, product pictures are misleading. Fool customers with bright looking pictures.
3. Monitor support only 60hz refresh rate @ 1080p and but the description claims this monitor to be full HD 75 Hz monitor.
4. Heavy flickering.

20015,3,"I received the monitor fairly quickly (2 days - thanks Amazon). picture quality is excellent and glare is considerably reduced compared to several other monitors in this range. It has a slim profile so does not take up a lot of space on your work desk. However, here are some cons:

1. This monitor is not height adjustable neither can it be pivoted (from left to right), which means that the description on Amazon's product page is incorrect. This is very annoying as one of the main reasons I bought this specific model was that it claimed to be height-adjustable. It can be tilted a few degrees from back to front, but most people will find this feature to be pretty useless;

2. Viewing angles are poor - anything more than 45 degrees in any direction and it fades. Great if you want screen privacy, pointless otherwise.

3. The holes in the base where you insert screws to fix the monitor's stand to the base are poorly machined. In my case, one screw refuses to go in fully and the monitor's base, therefore, stands at a slight tilt. It's hard to notice unless you go looking for it, but it's still a manufacturing error.

4. Speakers are below average. I had to crank up the volume to full to hear a YouTube video while sitting in a relatively quiet room; bass is non-existent. To compare, I bought a Dell E2420HS a month ago with broadly similar specs and that has outstanding sound. I'd bought it for work, but ended up using it to watch movies.",['Excellent monitor but...']

This is one of the best looking monitor and saves lot of space if you're primary source is connecting with a laptop.

Currently immensely regretting my decision to buy this item. The item has already been changed 3 times and it's yet to complete even 1 year. Apart from the 1st time , which I had a replacement with in the 1st week of purchase, every time got a refurbished product from TPlink service center and developed some form of trouble within few weeks.

It's ""broken"" again, and I'll go to their store for the 4th time. It's pros remained the same as mentioned in my earlier review (please refer below) but frequent disruption makes it completely a lost case.

I'll strongly suggest not to buy this item even if it available at dirty cheap price. I've read multiple reviews mentioning experiences from other buyers. You can read it too.

==========================================================
Initial review #Feb'18

Purchased this item after extensive research (both Offline and Online). The following is a summarized review after almost 1 month of extensive usage

Pros:
Simple no frill design
Dual antenna configuration
Excellent range. (Placed it at ground floor and getting excellent strength in the 1st floor)
Simple setup procedure with all required features (which should be suffice for home or SOHO users)

Cons:
* None till now

Why 4 Star and not 5
1. The first item delivered to me was defective (but got replaced seamlessly, thanks to Amazon)
Defect was extremely low speed in PC although wireless speed was fine. In case you face the same get it replaced.
2. it's too early to comment, if it really works for 12-15 more months; I'll come back and give it a 5 star

* I come from Network/Systems background and having extensive exposure to the field of Wired/Wireless networking; hence can confirm this is an excellent item in sub 1K price range.","[""DON'T Go for It... in case you don't want to regret later!!!""]"

20062,5,"Okay to start the review, I have been using Netgear N150 router for last 4 years and this time I needed a new router since devices were increasing in my house (Google chromecast, Google Home, Laptops and mobiles). My netgear router was not able to cover even a 2-BHK and when a lot of devices were connecting at the same time, the chromecast and google home stops working which was such a pain when one person wants to listen music or to steam videos on TV.
So, I finally decided and after reading a lot of reviews of different products zeroed on to this product - TP-LINK TL-WR940N Wireless-N450 Home Router (Mentioning full name since it seems amazon mixes all the reviews of different products of one brand into one list).
Pros -
1- The wifi range is good and comfortably covers my 2 BHK house, even after going some more distance away from home(around 20 meters) I get the range.
2- Able to connect multiple devices (MIMO tech works) (including chromecast, google home) without interruptions.
3- Can easily use this router as wifi range extender as well. A big plus for big homes.
4- T Plink app works fine with the router and you can easily customize settings there.
5- A RJ-45 cable comes inside the box, helps connecting my ACT broadband connection to laptop when there is no power.

Cons-
1. I got used to mutiple lights on my Netgear router, but his one has just single light. Turns blue if wifi connection is working fine and turns yellow if ISP connections breaks. Not a big concern. Just need to get used to it.",['More Range - More connected devices']

I have been using it since couple of weeks now and it is quite OK.

If you expect that it would work seamlessly and stream HD video than you should go for high end router, this one is for basic use which supports 2 GHz with limited wifi range.
